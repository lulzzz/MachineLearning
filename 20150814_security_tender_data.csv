It establishes a framework for monitoring of wholesale energy markets and prohibiting market abuse. REMIT requires the European energy regulatory authority, ACER (Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators), to monitor EU wholesale energy markets. It also requires ACER to work closely with national energy regulators and to exchange information with them, subject to safeguards as to the confidentiality of information. The Gas & Electricity Markets Authority (Ofgem) has been designated as the national regulatory authority for GB under REMIT. We are required to cooperate at regional level with ACER in carrying out the monitoring of wholesale energy markets. We may also monitor trading activity in wholesale energy products at a national level. Ofgem is also required to cooperate with ACER and with the national regulatory authorities of other Member States at a regional level to detect trading based on inside information and market manipulation. Ofgem is required to inform ACER of suspected breaches of REMIT either in GB or in another Member State. Ofgem will have access to relevant data for monitoring the wholesale market for abuse. ACER's data collection system (ARIS) will be the primary source, but there will be additional sources available to Ofgem. The surveillance system needs to: collect and validate all relevant data (ACER data and other sources within Ofgem, both current and future); automatically detect market abuse (insider trading and market manipulation) through a set of rules or alerts and allow Ofgem to design bespoke alerts; and, allow users to perform in depth analysis on these alerts, and produce reports on market activity.

The Framework will be awarded to a single supplier to respond to calls from the Collaborative Participants 24 hours a day, 365 days a year (366 days for a leap year) to attend insecure premises (including some sites owned by the Collaborative Participants), which need temporarily securing. The majority of securing will be completed by means of ‘boarding up'. The successful supplier will also be required to provide other methods of securing of premises including the replacement of lock barrels. Owing to the nature of the work required, the successful supplier will need to meet a maximum response time of 60 minutes to arrive at any location within the counties of Surrey and Sussex (East Sussex and West Sussex). In order to achieve this, the successful supplier may wish to subcontract work out to other providers, which is acceptable but must be agreed in advance and tightly managed.

This includes people whose death is imminent, those with advanced, progressive, incurable conditions, those who are frail and subject to co-existing conditions, people with existing conditions who are at risk of dying from a sudden acute crisis in their condition, and those with life-threatening acute conditions caused by sudden catastrophic events. Stage 1 of the contract will be fee based, for up to two years, and requires a prime provider/service integrator to manage the contracts for all the services along existing community care, long term condition (LTC) and acute care pathways as they relate to end of life, both for adults and for children as they transition to adult services. Stage 1 will entail: improving data quality and collection to establish the detailed real time information needed to proactively manage workstreams, predict demand, and understand patient and payment flows; achieving a limited set of service outcomes focused on improving the patient's experience of the service and ensuring equality of access and treatment, including better identification of need; identifying gaps in service provision. Achievement of Stage 1 will trigger the commencement of Stage 2. In Stage 2 the provider will assume responsibility for managing the provision of end of life care, in expectation of streamlining the service model and eliminating gaps in provision. Performance will be against ambitious clinical and service outcomes, and may include payment based on a risk/gain share arrangement. The required services model will enable identification of all those requiring end of life care, move provision ‘downstream' closer to service users, and allow them and their families seamless access to the right services at the right time."

Gatwick Airport is seeking to award a Framework Agreement for the supply of eGates and has an immediate requirement to raise a call-off contract for 21 units along with the associated support and maintenance services for the useful life of the asset. Future call-offs from the framework will be subject to the evolving requirements of the airport. The Passenger Validation eGate project is one element of a larger programme to redevelop the North Terminal. This programme of work will deliver a brand new security search area within the existing Check-In Zones F, G & H. This new security area will provide a world class facility utilising state of the art passenger and baggage screening technologies, bringing operational efficiencies and a great passenger experience. Passenger validation is the initial touch point with our passengers as they approach the security screening areas. Today, the passenger validation process in the North Terminal is dated and manual. This passenger experience needs to equal that of the proposed screening steps in terms of look and feel. It needs to be intuitive, modern and innovative, and give the passenger a great first impression to add to the overall impression of our validation and screening process. The new facility needs to process our growing passenger numbers which are forecast to peak around 4 500 passengers per hour in the North Terminal by 2020."

"2014/S 244-430184","430184-2014","Security services","Contract notice",2014,"Short description of the contract or purchase(s)","Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (the ‘Trust’) is interested in seeking a private sector partner (‘Partner’) to provide an intelligent infrastructure strategy function that will support the Trust's clinical strategy to enable service change, improve quality of care for patients and drive efficiency in the Trust's operations including potentially through (but not limited to): estates rationalisation; capital programme planning; raising finance and investment; strategic service transformation planning; and also the procurement and project/contract management of a range of services including construction and FM services. It is expected that these services will be provided to the Trust through the establishment of a joint venture body (JV) between the Trust and the Partner. The Trust predominantly provides services from Queen's Hospital in Burton, Sir Robert Peel Community Hospital in Tamworth and Samuel Johnson Community Hospital in Lichfield. Both of the sites in Lichfield and Tamworth provide a range of services including inpatient and outpatient services, and Minor Injuries Units. Maternity services are provided at Queen's Hospital and Samuel Johnson Community Hospital. The Trust offers a total of just over 540 beds as well as a wide range of general hospital services and a purpose built Treatment Centre. The Trust intends to redevelop/dispose of an adjacent site (Outwoods site). The Partner will provide the Priority Services (more particularly described below) through the JV upon appointment of the successful partner or shortly thereafter. Responsibility for procuring, co-ordinating and managing the provision of Secondary Services (more particularly described below) through the JV may be transferred to the Partner during the term of the partnership. The Partner will be expected to deliver Priority Services consisting of Strategic Estates Services. This includes the provision of consultancy support services to provide estate strategy advice (with a focus on achieving efficiencies), preparation of an estates strategy that will support the Trust's clinical strategy and drive efficiency in the Trust's operations and the preparation, review and updating of a partnership business plan to cover the proposed need, phasing of service transformation at the Trust's estate and the timing of the delivery of any proposed new projects or refurbishment projects to deliver capital requirements (‘New Projects’). The Partner is also expected to provide access to, arrange and deliver private sector capital where required to finance New Projects. New Projects may involve (but are not limited to) capital works; refurbishment works; disposal and/or acquisition of land; facilities to support NHS services, related health and social care services as well as commercial developments. Initial New Projects may potentially include: — The transformation of services through Community Hospitals and accommodation for the elderly to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of the estate and services. —  The redevelopment/disposal of the Outwoods site in Burton and redistribution of the vacated services to the Queen's Hospital site. —  A car parking solution that will complement the Trust's commitment to a green transport plan and improve patient/public experience. —  Commercial opportunities for the benefit of the Trust and patients, including catering/a new front entrance/patient contact and customer service opportunities. To ensure value for money is achieved at the time when projects are commenced and services required, (and in observing EU procurement principles on behalf of the Trust) it is expected that the JV, via a secondary procurement, will competitively tender the supply chain for each New Project or Secondary Service required. The Partner (through the JV) will therefore provide an integrator role in procuring and coordinating these third-party providers to deliver schemes and services for the benefit of the Trust. This integrator role includes the provision of operational project management services in procuring, co-ordinating and managing external contractors engaged to deliver any proposed and approved New Projects to deliver capital requirements for works, fabrication or traditional estate project procurements and also any external contractors required to deliver Secondary Services approved by the Trust. The Partner's integrator role may also include providing operational procurement consultancy services in co-ordinating, managing and conducting procurements observing EU procurement principles to appoint a supply-chain to the JV to deliver those services; and The Partner may be required to plan, procure, co-ordinate and manage Secondary Services which may include: (1) Facility Support Services —  which may include Facilities Management (including Estates Helpdesk and Energy Management (and incidental energy generation)); Catering; Cleaning; Laundry; Parking and Traffic Management; Security (Infrastructure); Portering; Pest Control; Grounds and Gardens Maintenance; and Clinical and General Waste; and (2) Customer Satisfaction Services —  which may include but not be limited to Reception Services, Customer Satisfaction Services, Patient Contact Centre Services; and (3) Corporate Back Office Services. The opportunity is to provide a strategic, commercial, development, investment, procurement, project management and contract management role in delivering capital projects and transforming services to support the Trust's clinical strategy but the scope does not include the provision of delivering the detailed design and construction aspects of the New Projects or the provision of Secondary Services themselves. The Trust is interested in the JV seeking other commercial and income generation opportunities in the public and private sector market over the long-term and proposing innovative proposals in support of the Trust's clinical strategy that will maximise income or allow the Trust to reduce costs. The JV partnership with the successful Partner will be for a period of 10 years with an option to extend the contract for a further 5 years. Further details of the opportunity are provided in the Memorandum of Information accompanying the pre-qualification questionnaire (see section VI.3 (Additional Information) for details of how to obtain these)."

Ofcom was created in December 2003 by merging five legacy regulatory bodies and responsibility for postal regulation transferred to Ofcom in October 2011. For more information, visit www.ofcom.org.uk Ofcom plans to procure a selected number of services under a total facilities management contract across its estate of seven buildings to succeed those provided under the terms of Ofcom's current facilities management contracted arrangements. The service delivery at all the sites will become the responsibility of the supplier that is successful in the new procurement and is awarded the new total facilities management contract. We intend the scope of the contract to include the following: Manager — Currently a full time manager is based at RSH. With the increase in service provision across all locations a pro-active approach to the day to day and strategic management of the contract is required to ensure client satisfaction. The manager would be expected to have a background skill set in both hard and soft services.

Going forward it is envisaged that the appointed supplier will review the Help-desk requirements and provide a service having a clear understanding of any current issues and able to respond to meet those during core hours. At all other times the Help-desk needs to be aware of issues and provide a help-desk function aligned to the SLAs and KPIs.

The supplier will be required to identify non legislative compliance and non-conformance to agreed best practise and pro-actively manage the programme to correct these issues pragmatically. Energy management — The appointed supplier will have significant experience in this field and will utilise dedicated in-house and specialist resource to pro-actively promote energy management through focussed initiatives.

The supplier will be pro-active in providing advice on current best practise.

Lifts — The appointed supplier will be responsible for optimising the operation and maintenance of the vertical transportation (Lifts) taking account of legislations, usage and energy. Security — The appointed supplier will actively work with Ofcom in maintaining the various systems such as Intruder alarms and access control systems.

"2014/S 212-376252","376252-2014","Data security software development services","Contract notice",2014,"Short description of the contract or purchase(s):","There is a requirement to have a framework to enable United Utilities to operate a managed service and deliver transformation within Lot G (Security Operations) of its Networks and Telephony portfolio. Other Lots will be procured via a separate contract notice. Our security managed service is a key contributor to how we protect our business and the scope of services within this provide the baseline for the differentiated layers of protection we apply across our business. The security managed service will provide the standard device management and security monitoring and alerting activities that provide the day to day tactical levels of security protection. In addition, as we look forward to the ever changing and increasingly complex threat landscape, we need to be more informed and we therefore expect the security managed service to provide the intelligence and thought leadership around threats and to provide the enhanced levels of vulnerability and risk assessments and recommendations to ensure we are protected to an optimum level. The security managed service is required to augment the in-house NOC/SOC with monitoring support, threat analysis and assessment. e.g. firewall management, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). It is envisaged that the managed service will be delivered by one framework partner and the transformation requirements will be delivered by two framework partners (of which one will include the managed service framework partner). The key requirement is to ensure a flexible approach when calling off individual contracts and frameworks. Any call off from the established frameworks will be dependent upon the required funding approvals. The initial term is for 3 years with an option to extend up to 4 additional years. The period of extension/s shall be at the sole discretion of United Utilities."

This framework will be let by the contracting authority and can be utilised by NHS Trusts, NHS Foundation Trusts (including PFI healthcare buildings and facilities), NHS Collaborative Procurement Organisations, Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS England and NHS Property Services Ltd. The framework duration will be 2 years with the option to extend by up to 24 months, using two twelve month blocks (2 x 12 months). This framework will enable participating organisations to conduct further (mini) competitions with selected service providers as and when their organisation's requirement arises. The framework will be divided into Lots to cover specific areas of Maintenance Services. The lots have been separated into two categories: 1. Maintenance Service Lots. 2. Geographic Regions. This categorisation will allow suppliers the flexibility to tender for specific maintenance services in selected areas of geographic coverage. 1. Maintenance Service Lots. The Maintenance Services are given in the Lots listed below. Providers will submit tenders based on their experience and capabilities in the individual Lots, and on the regions to be covered. It is envisaged that providers will submit their tenders in the following combinations: A Tender for only one Maintenance Service Lot (a single Lot within Lots 1 through to 14), A Tender for multiple Maintenance Service Lots (a combination within Lots 1 through to 14), A Tender for all the Maintenance Service options (Lots 1 through to 14). Providers are at liberty to tender for any or all of the Lots in each region.

These further (mini) competitions are dependant on the specific requirements of the Trusts and other framework users within the regions, and therefore may be for any number of the Lots, — For clarification please note that providers can only be selected for any further (mini) competitions based on the specific lots that they have tendered for and consequently been awarded. For example, a provider tendering for Lot 1 only will not be eligible to participate in any further (mini) competitions for Lots 2 through to 14. The maintenance service lots to be tendered for are: Lot 1 — Fully Managed Building and Engineering Maintenance Service. Lot 2 — Cooling and Refrigeration — Chillers, Condensers, Split A/C's.

The NHS England website can be accessed via: www.england.nhs.uk By accessing the website, providers may determine the geographic coverage of each region, (as covered as at the date of publication of this Notice), and conclude on which Regional Lot(s) they wish to tender for. A Memorandum of Information will be issued with the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire giving more details on the scope of this agreement."

The Ministry of Defence has a requirement for a Service Provider to deliver a range of services, predominantly human, to contribute to the creation of realistic training environments for military forces preparing them through Individual phased training and collectively for deployed operations worldwide. The training support provided will integrate with existing Individual and collective training structures to ensure that trainees are sufficiently trained and experienced in military Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), Field craft and to operate in the demanding and complex contemporary and future environments encountered on operations. These training support services will be provided initially to the MOD and potentially other government departments within the UK and Worldwide. Key services delivered will include, but not necessarily be limited to, human, Demonstration Forces (DEMFOR), Opposing Forces (OPFOR), state and non-state actors plus their networks; the indigenous population through accurate replication of culture, language, social structures and population dynamics, an accurate replication of the indigenous security forces, a representation of battlefield casualties (CASSIM) to support immediate medical response training; and support to conceptual training that is designed to significantly increase the depth of UK forces' cultural understanding of the environment in which they will operate and physical representation of that required environment (including the provision of replica urban props and soft infrastructure). Additional training support tasks that enhance realism by design and effect which are unavailable from internal resources, which contribute directly to successful training delivery are included within the scope of this advert, such as but not limited to scenario writing, pyrotechnic effects, labourers and limited security roles. Training is currently delivered throughout the year at military training establishments and training areas, primarily within the UK and Europe, but potentially at other locations. Demand is variable and is set annually and the service provided will need to be responsive to increases/decreases in demand. Initially in the order of 57 000 Man Training Days (MTDs) spread over the year with the current requirement highlighting peaks of demand that involve upwards of 400 role players over a period of approximately 7-10 consecutive days, six or seven times per year. Numbers of role players per event will vary from one person for one day to the peaks described above. There are circa 300 events spread throughout the year, events can run concurrently but major events rarely coincide. There is a requirement to support surge and short notice training activities that demand flexibility and agility in constructing bespoke environments. The Service Provider will need to be intelligent, responsive and adaptive in its delivery through a holistic management mechanism that works closely with the customer to deliver realistic training support responsive to an ever changing and challenging operational environment. Contractor performance will be measured against Training Objectives (TO). Training Objectives are set by the Authority to assess a Training Audience performance against those objectives required to meet military tasks. The provider should reach an objective standard of performance to contribute actively to the success of the training mission."

Internationally connected, the Campus will enable thriving businesses to work hand in hand in sharing knowledge and resources with those in research and education. The Phase 1 infrastructure contract was completed in the Summer of 2013 with a number of different bodies now developing individual plots with the first buildings likely to be completed in 2015. See http://www.invernesscampus.co.uk for more information. This contract will be awarded on behalf of the Inverness Campus Owners Association (ICOA). This is made up of representatives of site owners within Phase 1 although, for some years, the ICOA will effectively be controlled by HIE since it will remain the principal owner of the development plots. The current members are Highlands & Islands Enterprise and Inverness College UHI. Note, this tender does not cover security services for buildings or structures (other than the Security Office and Maintenance Compound) which may be erected by others on the development plots. However, the successful bidder will be expected to co-operate with plot developer's on-site security staff as and when required.

The Cabinet Office, on behalf of HM Government (HMG) is seeking to appoint a PSP to establish, and be majority shareholder in, a DMI that is capable of delivering a suite of debt management services to a range of UK government departments and other UK Contracting Authorities. The DMI will offer a range of existing and new services that provide improved debt management and increased net yield through better debt analytics, debt collection, debt enforcement, litigation and fraud and error services and possibly debt sales. It is expected that the PSP, through the DMI, will have/provide: 1. A proven ability to deliver reliable, high quality and innovative retail debt management services at scale in the UK; or an equivalent proven scale retail debt services delivery capability elsewhere, together with comprehensive and credible evidence of sufficient practical understanding of the UK debt market and experience of successfully adapting retail debt operations to demonstrate the ability to succeed in the UK; 2. A proven ability to manage a supply chain in the debt services arena; 3. A proven ability to adapt services to comply with relevant local legislative, regulatory requirements and good practice; 4. Experience of working successfully in joint ventures or partnerships with the public or private sector; 5. Initial funding to establish the DMI company; and 6. The ability to grow a sustainable and profitable business. The Departments that are collaborating with the Cabinet Office as ‘Initial Customers' of the DMI are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP), the Student Loans Company (SLC), the Legal Aid Agency (LAA), the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the Home Office (HO), however, the Cabinet Office envisages the DMI will offer cost effective debt management services to all its customers including other UK Contracting Authorities. Potential Bidders should note that the composition of Initial Customers could be subject to change during the procurement process. HMG will retain a significant minority equity stake in the DMI with corresponding Board representation including an influence in its future strategy and growth. HMG will retain responsibility for UK debt-related policy and legislation. It is expected that the DMI will be a non-public corporate entity with a Board and Management team appointed by its owners. Its growth and profitability will be directly linked to its ability to improve debt management and increase net yield for HMG and other customers. The successful bidder for the role of PSP will, through the procedure contemplated by this Notice, acquire and hold equity share capital in the DMI through a Shareholders' Agreement, Articles of Association, Subscription Agreement and other relevant documents. The Cabinet Office recognises that, in order to provide the services required and achieve the stated objectives, the PSP may use sub-contractors to provide some of the services. We also welcome consortia bids. In all cases, we expect to contract with a single entity and expect a simple, transparent and credible Governance structure between parties. It is expected that the DMI will provide the sole route to market for debt management for the Initial Customers. The debt management services to be provided by the DMI are a comprehensive and integrated suite of debt management services including, but not limited to: — Analytics (for example but not limited to Predictive Modelling, Collection Optimisation, Purchase and use of Business/Market Intelligence, Decision Analytics, Case Management); — Collection (for example but not limited to Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management, Management of third party suppliers of these services); — Enforcement and Litigation (Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments and Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management); — Fraud and error services; — Debt Sales; and — Strategic and tactical advice on improving debt yields. The DMI services should be flexible, allowing customers of the DMI a choice to procure either a single service or any number of services across the whole range of offerings in order to satisfy individual circumstances, timetables and specific requirements. DMI services should be delivered in the context of the spirit of treating debtors fairly – in particular those in hardship. The Cabinet Office will award to the PSP a Framework Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Notice. Call Off Contracts will then be entered into between the DMI and the Initial Customers. Details of the volumes of debt from Initial Customers can be found in the IM which will be made available as part of the PQQ process. In addition to the Initial Customers referred to above, it is intended that the Framework Agreement will allow the DMI to provide the services specified above to other public sector bodies including but not limited to all UK Government Departments and their Arm's Length Bodies and Agencies; Non Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs); NHS bodies, Local Authorities and devolved administrations of Scotland and Northern Ireland (together the 'Participating Bodies'). See Section VI for further details of those Participating Bodies that will be able to use the Framework Agreement and enter into Call Off Contracts under it. Further information on the scope of services can be found in the Information Memorandum."

The Cabinet Office, on behalf of HM Government (HMG) is seeking to appoint a PSP to establish, and be majority shareholder in, a DMI that is capable of delivering a suite of debt management services to a range of UK government departments and other UK Contracting Authorities. The DMI will offer a range of existing and new services that provide improved debt management and increased net yield through better debt analytics, debt collection, debt enforcement, litigation and fraud and error services and possibly debt sales. It is expected that the PSP, through the DMI, will have/provide: 1. A proven ability to deliver reliable, high quality and innovative retail debt management services at scale in the UK; or an equivalent proven scale retail debt services delivery capability elsewhere, together with comprehensive and credible evidence of sufficient practical understanding of the UK debt market and experience of successfully adapting retail debt operations to demonstrate the ability to succeed in the UK; 2. A proven ability to manage a supply chain in the debt services arena; 3. A proven ability to adapt services to comply with relevant local legislative, regulatory requirements and good practice; 4. Experience of working successfully in joint ventures or partnerships with the public or private sector; 5. Initial funding to establish the DMI company; and 6. The ability to grow a sustainable and profitable business. The Departments that are collaborating with the Cabinet Office as ‘Initial Customers' of the DMI are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP), the Student Loans Company (SLC), the Legal Aid Agency (LAA), the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the Home Office (HO), however, the Cabinet Office envisages the DMI will offer cost effective debt management services to all its customers including other UK Contracting Authorities. Potential Bidders should note that the composition of Initial Customers could be subject to change during the procurement process. HMG will retain a significant minority equity stake in the DMI with corresponding Board representation including an influence in its future strategy and growth. HMG will retain responsibility for UK debt-related policy and legislation. It is expected that the DMI will be a non-public corporate entity with a Board and Management team appointed by its owners. Its growth and profitability will be directly linked to its ability to improve debt management and increase net yield for HMG and other customers. The successful bidder for the role of PSP will, through the procedure contemplated by this Notice, acquire and hold equity share capital in the DMI through a Shareholders' Agreement, Articles of Association, Subscription Agreement and other relevant documents. The Cabinet Office recognises that, in order to provide the services required and achieve the stated objectives, the PSP may use sub-contractors to provide some of the services. We also welcome consortia bids. In all cases, we expect to contract with a single entity and expect a simple, transparent and credible Governance structure between parties. It is expected that the DMI will provide the sole route to market for debt management for the Initial Customers. The debt management services to be provided by the DMI are a comprehensive and integrated suite of debt management services including, but not limited to: — Analytics (for example but not limited to Predictive Modelling, Collection Optimisation, Purchase and use of Business/Market Intelligence, Decision Analytics, Case Management); — Collection (for example but not limited to Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management, Management of third party suppliers of these services); — Enforcement and Litigation (Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments and Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management); — Fraud and error services; — Debt Sales; and — Strategic and tactical advice on improving debt yields. The DMI services should be flexible, allowing customers of the DMI a choice to procure either a single service or any number of services across the whole range of offerings in order to satisfy individual circumstances, timetables and specific requirements. DMI services should be delivered in the context of the spirit of treating debtors fairly – in particular those in hardship. The Cabinet Office will award to the PSP a Framework Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Notice. Call Off Contracts will then be entered into between the DMI and the Initial Customers. Details of the volumes of debt from Initial Customers can be found in the IM which will be made available as part of the PQQ process. In addition to the Initial Customers referred to above, it is intended that the Framework Agreement will allow the DMI to provide the services specified above to other public sector bodies including but not limited to all UK Government Departments and their Arm's Length Bodies and Agencies; Non Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs); NHS bodies, Local Authorities and devolved administrations of Scotland and Northern Ireland (together the 'Participating Bodies'). See Section VI for further details of those Participating Bodies that will be able to use the Framework Agreement and enter into Call Off Contracts under it. Further information on the scope of services can be found in the Information Memorandum."

The Contracting Authority intends to use the competitive dialogue procedure of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (as amended) to procure both a public contract (""the Contract"") and a framework agreement (""the Framework Agreement"") (see below). The Contracting Authority intends to procure the Contract for its own benefit and for others to whom it has an obligation to provide certain services. It is anticipated that the Contract will cover a wide range of services and some works elements (""the Services"") including without limitation the following: — Cleaning; — Building engineering services; — Security; — Helpdesk; — Building Maintenance; — CCTV (manned control room); — CCTV maintenance; — Courier; — Porterage and office moves; — Hospitality; — Pest Control; — H&S/Statutory compliance; — H&S/Statutory training provision; — Fire safety services; — Minor Projects; — Utilities Management; — Professional services. This list is not exhaustive and consideration may be given during the procurement process to the inclusion of additional services or options for additional services which will assist in delivering the Services. In addition, the Contracting Authority is keen to make the benefits of the Services delivered under the Contract available to publicly funded schools in the Royal Borough of Kingston (those being local authority maintained schools and Academies established under the Academies Act 2010) and other neighbouring public bodies in the area, namely the London Borough of Wandsworth. The Contracting Authority is also therefore seeking to procure a separate framework agreement (""the Framework Agreement"") for the Services and services substantially similar to the Services. The Contracting Authority will be acting as a central purchasing body through which the following organisations may choose, but shall not be obliged, to procure the Services using the Framework Agreement: (1) the other local authorities and publicly funded bodies that are identified in his contract notice, namely the London Borough of Wandsworth (""the Participating Bodies""); and (2) all publicly-funded schools (those being local authority maintained schools and Academies as defined under the Academies Act 2010) within the geographical areas of the Contracting Authority. Accordingly it is the intention that all these organisations should be able to rely on this procurement to purchase such services without the need for any further procurement process. Full details of the exact services constituting the Services will appear in the tender documentation, as will details of the mechanisms to be used by the Participating Bodies and other organisations to place orders for the Services (""call-off contracts"") under the Framework Agreement. The duration of an individual call-off contract under the Framework Agreement will not necessarily be limited to four years but will be governed by the precise subject matter of the call-off contract concerned.

No guarantee or warranty is given as to the nature or volume, if any, of the Services or the number of call-offs, if any, under the Framework Agreement. It should also be noted that in addition to any change in the structure or identity of the Contracting Authority and/or the Participating Bodies in the event of re-structuring within local government, this procurement and/or the Contract and any Framework Agreement awarded will pass to successor authorities to the Contracting Authority and the Participating Authorities as relevant and appropriate.

As part of its Transformation Agenda, the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames (""the Contracting Authority"") is undertaking a Total Facilities and Property Management Project. The Contracting Authority intends to use the competitive dialogue procedure of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (as amended) to procure both a public contract (""the Contract"") and a framework agreement (""the Framework Agreement"") (see below). The Contracting Authority intends to procure the Contract for its own benefit and for others to whom it has an obligation to provide certain services. It is anticipated that the Contract will cover a wide range of services and some works elements (""the Services"") including without limitation the following: — Cleaning; — Building engineering services; — Security; — Helpdesk; — Building Maintenance; — CCTV (manned control room); — CCTV maintenance; — Courier; — Porterage and office moves; — Hospitality; — Pest Control; — H&S/Statutory compliance; — H&S/Statutory training provision; — Fire safety services; — Minor Projects; — Utilities Management; — Professional services. This list is not exhaustive and consideration may be given during the procurement process to the inclusion of additional services or options for additional services which will assist in delivering the Services. In addition, the Contracting Authority is keen to make the benefits of the Services delivered under the Contract available to publicly funded schools in the Royal Borough of Kingston (those being local authority maintained schools and Academies established under the Academies Act 2010) and other neighbouring public bodies in the area, namely the London Borough of Wandsworth. The Contracting Authority is also therefore seeking to procure a separate framework agreement (""the Framework Agreement"") for the Services and services substantially similar to the Services. The Contracting Authority will be acting as a central purchasing body through which the following organisations may choose, but shall not be obliged, to procure the Services using the Framework Agreement: (1) the other local authorities and publicly funded bodies that are identified in his contract notice, namely the London Borough of Wandsworth (""the Participating Bodies""); and (2) all publicly-funded schools (those being local authority maintained schools and Academies as defined under the Academies Act 2010) within the geographical areas of the Contracting Authority. Accordingly it is the intention that all these organisations should be able to rely on this procurement to purchase such services without the need for any further procurement process. Full details of the exact services constituting the Services will appear in the tender documentation, as will details of the mechanisms to be used by the Participating Bodies and other organisations to place orders for the Services (""call-off contracts"") under the Framework Agreement. The duration of an individual call-off contract under the Framework Agreement will not necessarily be limited to four years but will be governed by the precise subject matter of the call-off contract concerned. The form of the call-off contract will be agreed during the current procurement process and set out in the final Framework Agreement, subject to the right to make specific amendments in respect of an individual call-off. No guarantee or warranty is given as to the nature or volume, if any, of the Services or the number of call-offs, if any, under the Framework Agreement. It should also be noted that in addition to any change in the structure or identity of the Contracting Authority and/or the Participating Bodies in the event of re-structuring within local government, this procurement and/or the Contract and any Framework Agreement awarded will pass to successor authorities to the Contracting Authority and the Participating Authorities as relevant and appropriate. It is anticipated that services delivered under the Contract will commence on or around 1 October 2015 It is intended that the Contracting Authority shall also enter into the Framework Agreement on or around this date, although the timing of any call-offs under the Framework Agreement will be a matter to be decided between the relevant Participating Authority and the supplier. The Contracting Authority currently envisages that the Contract and any Framework Agreement would be awarded to the successful supplier in its own right. Nevertheless, the Contracting Authority is currently interested in exploring during competitive dialogue whether there would be advantages in the Contracting Authority (on behalf of itself or together with one or more of the Participating Bodies) procuring a strategic private sector partner with which to form a joint venture company to which the Contract and any Framework Agreement would be awarded. The Contracting Authority therefore reserves the right at its entire discretion as part of the current procurement to procure alongside the delivery of the Contract and Framework Agreement a partner with which to form a joint venture company. The Contracting Authority also reserves the right not to pursue this further. Details will appear in the tender documentation. The Contracting Authority reserves the right to award: — only the Contract and not any Framework Agreement; — the Framework Agreement alone; — a Contract and/or Framework Agreement covering only part of the Services; — neither the Contract nor the Framework Agreement.

PP has formed an alliance with Cumbria Housing Partners (CHP), Procure Plus Associates (PPAL) and Efficiency North (EN). Subject to business requirement this alliance may from time to time include other housing associations and/or social housing consortia in the United Kingdom. This alliance is known collectively as Re:allies. Further additional social housing consortia may join the Re:allies alliance from time to time. Further background information can also be obtained by visiting www.re:allies.com. PP is a regeneration company and social and economic improvement is our fundamental purpose. We establish framework agreements that leverage demand for works, goods and services in the construction market. PPs members, clients and customers are wholly committed to the creation of training and employment opportunities for individuals who are furthest from the labour market, groups that are under-represented within the construction industry or individuals that may otherwise be overlooked or marginalised within the labour market. These groups include, but are not limited to, people from a black or minority ethnic background, ex-offenders, females and young people who are not in education, employment or training. PP has identified that works to social housing properties, and in particular, works to empty properties, create an ideal basis for the individuals described to attain employability skills and eventually progress from entry level positions through to becoming a qualified tradesperson. PP wishes to procure and enter into a framework agreement that targets those Contractors who can complete the works required and who can demonstrate they share PPs goal of supporting individuals from hard to reach groups into training and long term employment. Contractors will have to provide clear evidence that the foundational values of their organisation directly support the social value aims of this framework agreement and that regeneration is a core organisational activity. The framework agreement will be divided into six Lots and will cover three categories of works that range from waste clearance, property cleans and the installation of preventative security measures to the minor and major repair and refurbishment of social housing properties. Further details of these Lots and the works and regions that they each cover are set out in Annex B of this Notice. The Contractors appointed to each Lot will be required to actively recruit and retain individuals from hard to reach groups. The Contractors appointed to each Lot will be measured on the quality of the works completed and on the number of individuals who progress to work ready status, and achieve employment and qualifications as a result of the Contractors input and development. The works will be predominantly completed in vacant social housing properties but they may also be required in occupied properties as part of a planned and cyclical maintenance programme. The framework agreement will be in place for a period of four years and will not be extended beyond this period, however contracts called-off under the framework agreement may, where appropriate, continue beyond the 4 year term of the framework. Individual contracting authorities entitled to access the framework agreement will have the option to agree and award call off contracts at any stage during the term of the framework. The following contracting authorities will be entitled to agree and award call off contracts under the proposed framework agreement as and when required- 1. PPs members (both current and future). A list of PPs current members is set out in section VI.3 of this Notice. 2. CHPs members (both current and future). A list of CHPs current members is set out in section VI.3 of this Notice. 3. PPALs members (both current and future). A list of PPALs current members is set out in section VI.3 of this Notice. 4. Any partner or customer of PP, CHP, PPAL, or other member from time to time, which may include any social housing provider in the United Kingdom. Social housing provider for this purpose means any provider of social housing and includes registered housing providers (a list of these can be found by visiting www.homesandcommunities.co.uk), local authorities, local government ALMOs and unitary authorities. A list of PPs current partners and customers is set out in section VI.3 of this Notice. The contracting authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 above have requirements predominantly within the North West of England. The contracting authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 above shall be under no obligation to use the framework agreement. The framework agreement will be entered into by PP and the successful Contractors however the framework agreement may be novated from PP to Re:allies if and when Re:allies is incorporated."

As set out in the PIN and accompanying Prospectus for the Future IT Sourcing Programme (FITS) the MoJ's current major ICT contracts were negotiated prior to the creation of the MoJ. As a result, the contracts are broadly aligned to business units within the Authority (e.g. NOMS, HMCTS, Headquarters) rather than supporting economic, standard and integrated services across the Authority. These legacy contracts are due to expire in the next few years. The FITS Programme has been established to implement a Service Tower operating model for the delivery of ICT Services across the MoJ and to procure replacement contracts that align with and support this model. This Contract Notice covers the procurement of Protective Monitoring (PM) services. MoJ does not propose to place any specific constraints on the number or combination of contracts for which any supplier may bid in this and later competitions. However, in order to minimise any conflict of interest, the successful bidder for PM services will be asked to demonstrate appropriate ethical walls are in place between the parts of its organisation responsible for the delivery of PM services and those parts that may be responsible for the delivery of services in other Service Towers. Providers who are considering bidding for other Towers and who might be selected for the PM tower should consider the implications this will have for them. Providers should also take note that the FITS programme intends to use pan-government frameworks for some of the FITS Lots e.g. PSN for Networks, and will need to consider the impact of bidding against MoJ's requirements within these frameworks if they are also bidding for other Lots in the FITS Programme. Suppliers who are considering bidding for EUC and any other service tower should consider the implications this will have for them, the MoJ and other Service Tower Providers. The MoJ is seeking to procure a fully managed protective monitoring capability from a single provider. Whilst the project will not mandate exactly how this capability should be delivered, it is anticipated that it will involve the deployment of equipment and software into other Tower environments, connectivity with these environments, and process interaction with the other Tower providers as well as with MoJ. Protective Monitoring will be deployed to areas of MoJ's ICT estate where it can achieve the most value. This will be determined by the results of risk assessments and reflected in MoJ's Protective Monitoring policy. HMG policy mandates that all estates processing protectively marked material must be able to successfully audit themselves and maintain comprehensive system logs. This is also a core requirement for connection to the GSi and PSN secure WAN communities. Specifically this requires the Ministry to be able to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the CESG authored Good Practice Guide 13 (‘GPG13') Protective Monitoring guidance as part of the accreditation and risk management processes. This notice invites suppliers to respond to the PQQ for this service which can be found here https://esourcing.justice.gov.uk Please read the instructions on Section VI which details how to respond to the notice. MoJ intends to invite a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 8 economic operators to tender for this work.

This contract notice is a voluntary notice and relates to contracts falling under Part B of Schedule 3 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (the ""Regulations""). Accordingly, in conducting this procurement the Authority is required to comply only with those aspects of the Regulations which are applicable to Part B services and it is not obliged to comply with any other aspects of the Regulations. The choice of the negotiated procedure (as set out in Section IV.1.1 below) should therefore not be regarded as an indication that the Authority will follow the detailed rules and timescales for a negotiated procedure under Regulation 17 of the Regulations (which does not apply to Part B services). The Authority intends to tailor the procurement process to meet its specific requirements, further details of which are outlined in the Background Information document and will be set out in the Invitation to Negotiate (""ITN"") documents. The services being procured are the administration and collection of criminal financial impositions on behalf of HMCTS. The aim of the procurement is to ensure that the management and payment of criminal fines and financial impositions associated with the police or other public authorities are undertaken in a more compliant, cost effective, efficient and timely manner. The principal scope of the services is expected to include: — The collection of criminal fines, costs, compensation, victims surcharge, back-duty and fixed penalties that have been registered as a fine; — Conditional cautions that have a financial element that have been issued by the Police; — The collection and enforcement of sureties related to order for Forfeiture of Recognizance issued by the First Tier Asylum and Immigration Tribunal; — All related back office administrative work, debt management, service centre activity (both inbound and outbound communications) and the administration of the Fines Collection Scheme under Schedule 5, Courts Act 2003; — All activities currently undertaken by Fixed Penalty Offices including the endorsement of licences, compliance activity, processing of payments and the registration of unpaid notices and orders as fines; — Activities currently undertaken by Confiscation Units where HMCTS is the Lead Enforcement Authority including compliance and collection activity associated with the management and tracking of confiscation orders with the exception of the court diary management and resulting of cases; — All activities associated with the management of warrants currently undertaken by HMCTS Civilian Enforcement Officers, contracted Approved Enforcement Agencies and local Police Forces; and — All relevant financial, accounting and money handling activities including those that support publication of the annual Trust Statement which reports the collection of revenues to be paid to HM Treasury.

The chosen provider must ensure that all hosting and support services occur within the UK. All testing must be undertaken in the UK unless full compliance with the MoJ Offshoring policy can be demonstrated. Any offshore testing must be agreed in advance with the Authority's Senior Information Risk Owner and the Cabinet Office. The procurement process will be used to satisfy the objectives and requirements for Compliance and Enforcement Services. This is a standalone competitive process and currently envisages the award of a services contract to a single supplier (which could be a single organisation or group (consortium)). The MoJ reserves the right at any stage and without notice, at its sole discretion, to alter the competition details and arrangements or to terminate this competition.

The whole site comprises 130 hectares of agricultural land owned almost entirely by the Council. The Council has a strong commitment to sustainable development and has prepared a clear vision for Ashton Green incorporated into a spatial masterplan (2010) and outline planning permission (2011). Ashton Green has been a strategic housing allocation since the mid-1970s and it is proposed that this site will play a major role in delivering the 20 000 new homes that Leicester needs over the next 15 to 20 years. The Council recognises the importance of the ""place making"" agenda through designing quality places and supporting sustainable communities. The Council will require the successful bidder to take forward the masterplan and outline planning permission and to deliver a significant first phase of approximately 23 hectares to include circa 950 low/zero carbon new homes with 30 % affordable housing, a new commercial village centre with a primary school, as the first phase of co-located community social infrastructure, up to 5 hectares of employment land, significant open space provision and early highways and public transportation improvements. Social, economic and environmental regeneration is important to the Council. Leicester City Council schemes propose to promote a stronger economy better able to meet the needs of the community and to develop measures to promote social inclusion. Therefore, successful bidders will be expected to assist the Council to fulfill these objectives through increasing the opportunities for employment and training."

"2012/S 30-48585","48585-2012","Absconder-tracing services","Contract notice",2012,"Short description of the contract or purchase(s)","This notice launches the competition for the provision of the next generation of electronic monitoring (EM) services and supplies in England and Wales contained in the four (4) lots identified below and in the ""Information about Lots"" set out in Section II.1.8 and in Annex B. EM services are currently used to facilitate the curfew of a subject given either a community order, court bail order or released on licence (collectively referred to as ‘Orders’). Bidders that initially respond to this notice and successfully pre-qualify will be pre-qualified to participate in the competition for the specified lots. From those bidders who meet the Authority's minimum pre-qualification criteria (pre-qualified bidders), a short-list of bidders will be selected for the next stage of the competition (the invitation to negotiate) – see further details below relating to the tendering and award restrictions and lot selection. The Authority shall use the competition to enable delivery of specific departmental strategic initiatives including those recently identified in the Authority’s Green Paper (“Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of Offenders”) and the competition strategy for offender services, particularly regarding the tracking of subjects. The scope of EM services will be divided into four elements (lots) as follows. I. Monitoring service including the processing centre, related hardware and software, and field operatives; II. Monitoring and mapping software applications; III. Monitoring hardware (anklets etc.) and firmware and software; IV. Network (Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)). The Authority reserves the right at any time to move certain functions between the lots. The successful monitoring service provider for lot (I) will be the service and system integrator. This means that the successful monitoring service provider will be given the power of agency to act on behalf of the Authority in appropriate areas to ensure that interface risks are properly managed with the monitoring service provider acting in some respects in the manner of a prime contractor with the service providers for lots (II), (III) and (IV) in the role of sub-contractors. For the avoidance of doubt, contracts for all lots will be awarded directly by the Authority, who will be solely responsible for bidder selection. Preferred bidders will be designated for all of the lots prior to award of contracts. Negotiations will then be concluded with all preferred bidders to establish a back-to-back service and system integration agreement, binding on all parties that will contain the appropriate commercial provisions supporting an end to end service to the Authority. The Authority is proceeding under the negotiated procedure on the grounds set out in Regulations 13(b) and 13(c) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006. Due to the complexity and technical nature of the services to be procured, it is not possible to fully specify in advance any preferred solutions and the Authority wishes to engage with bidders in order to identify what solutions are available on the market, including any potential innovations which different bidders may be able to offer. In particular it is also not possible to specify in advance how the lots will be integrated or how each potential provider will work with each other to deliver the services. The negotiated procedure will allow the Authority to identify operational risks across the service, which it is yet not possible to predict, and consider their management with bidders. The cost impact of risk acceptance and/or transfer will need to be discussed and agreed with bidders during the competition as the total operating model is developed and a system integration agreement is established. The Authority will need to be able to engage in meaningful and detailed discussions with preferred bidders regarding different service models in order to identify a final solution that is acceptable, robustly operable and capable of being priced. Taking into account the different specialisms required and the possible number of different proposals by bidders, it has not been possible to set an estimated overall price at the start of the procurement process other than to give an estimated range of values for the purposes of this notice. It is the Authority’s intention to deliver maximum alignment between the delivery of the Electronic monitoring service, the Ministry of Justice Future IT Strategy (FITS) and the Government’s ICT strategy. Specifically, the successful network service provider for lot (IV) must adhere to the Government Public Services Network (PSN) standards which will be updated from time to time during the course of the competition and term of the contract. Bidders shall make express reference to the current technical domain description - version 2.0 which may also be updated from time to time during the course of the competition and term of the contract. Further information about PSN can be obtained at http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network. It is the intention of the Authority to review the outcome of the Government's PSN Connectivity and services framework competitions, currently scheduled for award in Spring 2012. The Authority reserves the right to not to award any contract under lot (IV) and instead obtain Network services via the future PSN connectivity and / or services framework agreements [or under other agreements] in line with the Authority's FITS network tower/mobiles procurement approach. In the event that any part of the solution, for any of the lots, is based upon standard components which are available through Government framework agreements, the Authority reserves the right to either directly procure, or require the successful supplier to procure such items under the terms of the Government framework agreement. Tendering and award restrictions. As part of the pre-qualification and RFI process bidders are required to identify those lots they wish to bid for. All bidders may express an interest in a maximum of 3 lots. Bidders will be precluded from expressing an interest in, and bidding for, both lot (I) and lot (III) together (and this preclusion shall also apply to (a) the subsidiary and holding companies of the bidder and any other subsidiaries of the holding companies (as defined by s1159 Companies Act 2006) and to (b) any consortium members and significant subcontractors as defined in the RFI). Subject to the outcome of the Government PSN competition, one bidder may be successful in being awarded contracts for lots (I), (II), and (IV) or alternatively (II), (III) and (IV)– or may be successful in relation to individual lots within those groupings. The Authority will limit the number of bidders to be invited to negotiate per lot to a maximum of 4 in the case of lots (I), (III) and (IV). Where more than 4 bidders meet the Authority's minimum pre-qualification criteria for any of lots (I), (III) or (IV), the Authority will short-list the 4 highest ranking bidders for the relevant lot as assessed against the Authority's pre-qualification criteria. The Authority will limit the number of bidders to be invited to negotiate for lot (II) to a maximum of 7. Where more than 7 bidders meet the Authority's minimum pre-qualification criteria for lot (II), the Authority will short-list the 7 highest ranking bidders as assessed against the Authority's pre-qualification criteria provided that it shall only short-list the 6th and the 7th highest if its respective score is within 5 % of the score of the 5th highest ranking bidder for lot (II). The contract for lot (I) shall be for a period of six years. Contracts for lots (II), (III) and (IV) shall be for a period of three years. There will be options to extend the contracts in all of the lots as described in more detail in the information about lots section. The Authority may from time to time seek additional information or updates from those bidders that have pre-qualified to update, verify and confirm the details that they have provided. Further details are provided in the ""Information about Lots"" section and in the Authority's Request for Information (RFI). Details of how to respond to this notice and obtain the RFI are set out in Section VI.3. Greater detail of the interfaces between all lots and the Authority’s requirements will be provided in the invitation to negotiate (ITN) documentation."

These properties represent a precious collection of physical remains from a long span of England’s history. Ancient Monuments are protected in law, and it is a criminal offense to wilfully damage them.Many of the properties are ruins, and are therefore fragile by their very nature. Many are also unmanned and in rural locations, with obvious implications for security. Others on the edges of towns have different security issues. Houses with extremely valuable collections present high security risks.118 properties are staffed, and some are managed through Local Management Agreements, while the remainder are free to visit. Those properties which are staffed have a wide variety of opening times, and clearly the time when properties are un-staffed (usually out of season or at night) represent the highest (although not only) security risk.. EH requires an “Out of Hours” response at various sites. “Out of Hours” means those times when the site is secured and empty, typically overnight 365 days a year and also those daytimes when the sites are not in use."

The Council has contacted other local authorities to participate in the tender. The local authorities named below (together with the Council, the ""Participating Councils"") have agreed for the Council to act as lead procuring authority for the purposes of this tender. The joint aim of the Participating Councils is to reduce fuel poverty by aggregating their communities’ energy spend in order to achieve more affordable energy.

The solution shall include: — a ‘white-labelled’ web portal for each Participating Council's website, — implementation of paper based process for residents without access to the internet, — robust data security measures to protect resident's data, — a helpdesk service for resident's queries regarding the reverse auction, — standardised marketing materials, — communicating results of the reverse auctions, providing an energy price comparison to potential switchers and other administrative functions associated with running the reverse auction; and, — training and guidance to each Participating Council's staff. The intention is to initiate the first scheme at the start of the winter period of 2012/13 (in order to maximise the benefit to communities). The Contract will be entered into by the Council acting as a Central Purchasing Body for and on behalf of the Participating Councils. The Council currently has firm commitment to the scheme from the following councils: Blackpool Council. Bolton Council. Cheshire West and Chester Council. Hertfordshire County Council. London Borough of Havering Council. Luton Borough Council. Manchester City Council. Northumberland County Council. Stockport Council. Suffolk Coastal District Council. Trafford Council.

There is no requirement for breakfast Monday mornings or an evening meal Friday. Estimated numbers will normally be available up to one week in advance. On occasions students are accommodated in local hotels, therefore no breakfast requirements would be needed, but lunch and evening meals would need to be provided. Due to times of austerity there are no set intakes of students or set student numbers for training courses held. Training is now arranged ‘on demand’. Based on projected recruitment needs, it is proposed there will be an intake of 18 officers in 2012/13, and 36 officers in 2013/14.

Experience in supporting organisations of Home’s size and geographical spread with developing ICT strategy."
"2011/S 55-90100","90100-2011","Data security software development services","Contract notice",2011,"Short description of the contract or purchase(s)","Introduction. The process seeks to establish a framework agreement for the supply of ICT services and resources to support Home Groups existing ICT department in the delivery of cost effective and fit for purpose technology based solutions. Home has an existing ICT team which is spread over a number of disciplines and is looking to have arrangements in place to allow extra technical resources to be brought on line as workload dictates. Home is especially interested in respondents with proven approaches to the delivery of ICT services and solutions that are in line with Home’s current technology platform and future requirements (described in detail below). Particular consideration will be given to the quality and expertise of resources that would be available to Home. Summary of Technical Environment. Home Group Limited has in excess of 3200 desktop and laptops connected to a central data suite which houses approximately 200 servers/virtual servers. All desktop and laptops are built to a standard image, currently utilising Windows XP, SP3. This environment has Microsoft Outlook and Office deployed directly to the desktop with other line of business apps accessed through Citrix and increasingly through Internet Explorer. VMware is utilised for server virtualisation. The server farm is being upgraded from Windows 2003 to Windows 2008 SP2 (within the next 12 months. A number of database platforms are in use within the organisation with SQL Server predominate. Our IIE (Internet, Intranet, and Extranet) services are run internally from the organisation utilising the Share point environment. Microsoft BizTalk is becoming an increasingly important technology for multi-system communication and to allow us to engage effectively with our suppliers. Current focus for the department is the creation of a dedicated Contact Centre, part of which will be the implementation of the Lagan CRM solution with relevant integration into our core systems, in particular Capita’s Open Housing Management System and Cedar Open Financials. Home has approximately 400 BT WAN connected sites 100 Telewest/BT connected sites and a handful of Site-to-Site VPN'S. This is currently under review. Cisco comms equipment provides all connectivity within the infrastructure. Core VoIP technology is Avaya. Proposed Contract. The deliverable from this process will be a competitive framework agreement that will enable Home Group to competitively select IS technical or project resource from: — mini-tender (across all or a selection) or, — call off (from a fixed price list submitted at tender stage) specific. Proposed Contract Term: We envisage letting a contract of a maximum of 4 years’ duration (2 years plus potential 2 year extension) to suppliers. Contracts must include an optional 12 month break-clause that can be activated by Home Group should the supplier not achieve the agreed deliverables, performance or service level. High level specification. Home Group’s ICT department comprises of 60+ staff covering a wide range of ICT functions including: — Networking and Security, — Telecommunications, — Infrastructure Architecture and Maintenance, — Data Centre Management and Disaster Recovery, — Business Software and Applications Development and Support, — Onsite Technical Engineers, — Front Line Service Desk, — IS Operations (ITIL Processes; IT procurement and other internal and external facing services), — Project Management. The ICT team have to respond to a fast paced, changing business environment, provide exceptional levels of service to their colleagues, ensure that they deliver solutions following industry standard best practice and ensure that solutions are delivered in a controlled manner to the business. We expect our partners and individuals working under the framework agreement to fit into and work closely in conjunction with the technical teams, becoming valuable members of the team. Due to the number of projects undertaken at Home Group now and for the next 2-4 years, a framework agreement is required to enable Home Group to supplement their existing staff base with specialist skills as and when required, as well as supplementing their existing staff base with additional people when the demand for ICT resource is high."

The scanners and associated buildings are owned and operated by UKBA. The port operator in Eastern Docks is the Dover Harbour Board. The British Control Zone (BCZ) in Coquelles is part of the Eurotunnel site. The systems operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year with an approximate throughput of ten to twelve [10 to 12] full – sized freight vehicles per hour. Only accompanied ‘Ro-Ro (Roll on, Roll off) traffic is handled at both sites. Each scanner is enclosed by a structure approximately 15 metres wide by 42 metres long, containing one scanning gantry. This gantry is mounted on rails and driven by electric motors, moving over one target at a time. The vehicle occupants are removed and wait in an adjacent office. The requirement for Contractors is to service, support, maintain and repair all components, systems and features relating to the operation of the scanning system. This should include all aspects relating to normal operations, including the rails, drive systems, control systems, lighting (interior & exterior), doors, IT, software and all aspects of radiological containment. The required planned maintenance visits are normally to be undertaken between the hours of 09.00 and 17.00, though the Agency may exceptionally require work to be conducted outside of these hours for operational reasons. In the case of work scheduled to take more than one day, maintenance (as well as repair) operations may be required during weekends and public holidays. The Agency requires an onsite response to Dover or Coquelles as follows: — If travelling from the UK the Contractor should be on site in Dover or at the point of disembarkation from the UK to Coquelles within six [6] hours. — If travelling from the European Mainland the Contractor should be on site in Coquelles or at the point of disembarkation from Calais or Coquelles to the UK within six [6] hours.

The procurement for an ISP to help establish and support our employee - led mutual is highly innovative, and is being supported by the Cabinet Office as a national pilot. It is envisaged that the ISP will provide support and assistance for the creation and operation of the employee - led mutual, which is currently anticipated will be structured as a joint venture company with the share holding shared between the ISP and the employees (held on the employees’ behalf in an employee benefit trust). The Contracting Authority will have a contractual arrangement with the employee- led mutual for the employee - led mutual to provide some of the services, supplies and works listed below (and further defined in the initial descriptive document) for a period of not less than four years. The specific shareholding to be held by the ISP will be subject to the dialogue undertaken as part of this process, although under a joint venture structure, the maximum holding for any independent sector partner will be capped to balance ownership in favour of employee ownership. The Contracting Authority is working closely with the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster City Council, and it is intended that staff from all three boroughs will be transferred into the Mutual Joint Venture company under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. The Contracting Authority is procuring on behalf of all education bodies within the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham, the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster City Council for a independent partner to set up the employee - led mutual. The client side may reside with the Contracting Authority who will act on its behalf and that of the Participating Authorities. However, following the award of the Contract, the client - side arrangement may be transferred from the Contracting Authority to one of the other Participating Authorities. The primary purpose of creating the employee- led mutual is specifically to undertake the following services, supplies or works to “relevant educational establishments” defined below within the London boroughs of Hammersmith & Fulham, Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster commissioned either by the Contracting Authority or the governing bodies of these establishments. The relevant educational establishments collectively mean: — educational facilities (which will include primary and secondary schools and may include tertiary education), — other children's facilities (including but not limited to after school club facilities, youth clubs etc), — accommodation for adult education and Special Educational Needs (SEN) education, — community facilities whether co-located with any of the above facilities or freestanding (including but not limited to halls, drop-in centres, crèches, sheltered workshops etc). As a commercial organisation the employee led mutual will also offer its services to non-maintained schools,such as Academies and Free schools. The services, supplies and works to the relevant educational facilities will include either direct provision by the employee led mutual or the sub-contracting to other providers. The scope of the services, supplies and works to the relevant educational facilities may include: — (i) information communication and technology (""ICT"") services, — (ii) ICT supplies, — (iii) architectural services, — (iv) engineering services, — (v) construction related works, supplies and services (including lifecycle planned maintenance and reactive maintenance), — (vi) security services, — (vii) building services, — (viii) hard facilities management services (e.g. building fabric and mechanical installations), — (ix) soft facilities management services (e.g. catering, cleaning, security, and health & safety), — (x) educational support services, and — (xi) educational strategy services, — (xii) consultancy services (procurement projects e.g. free school meals)."

The requirement is for the appointed healthcare service partner to provide nursing care services and basic care and support for the NHS community hospital beds with the NHS providing medical and therapy services for these beds. The requirement is for the appointed development partner to finance, design, construct, and maintain new buildings which are suitable for accommodating: (i) an ambulatory care facility of 2 000 m2 (net area) (including outpatient clinics, physiotherapy and diagnostics) for the Trust, plus shared communal/support areas; and (ii) a 68-bedded community in-patient rehabilitation unit, which is expected to be occupied by NHS patients. And in addition, the Trust would be willing to consider the provision of a private nursing care bedded unit if there is a demonstrable cost benefit to (i) and (ii). The exact configuration as to how these 3 elements integrate to provide care and efficiency benefits will form part of design solutions proposed by the bidders during the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. The Trust expects to sell the freehold of the land (up to a maximum of 5.8 acres) to the developer required to build the facilities mentioned above. Once the facility/facilities are complete, the Trust is expected to take a leasehold interest from the developer of the ambulatory care facility. The Trust expects to enter into a service contract for the provision of nursing care services and basic care and support for the 68-bedded unit. The commercial details of the service contract and leasehold arrangements are still being developed and the final specification requirements will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. However at this stage it is envisaged that the term of the lease for the ambulatory care facility will be between 25-30 years and the optimum service contract period will be tested during dialogue and will be for a maximum of 30 years. The design and construction of the NHS element of the new Health and Social Care Centre will be in accordance with NHS guidance and the Trust’s specifications. The facilities covered by this procurement will be of high architectural quality and environmentally sustainable with the NHS element of the new facilities built to Breeam healthcare excellent standard. It is envisaged that the successful partner will also be required to provide Hard FM (facilities management) and Soft FM services to the ambulatory care facility and the 68-bedded community in-patient rehabilitation unit and private nursing care bedded unit (the provision of Soft FM being an integral part of the nursing care to be provided). The scope of the equipment provision specification and IM&T specification for the facilities will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. Should the proposed design solutions allow, it may be possible for the appointed partner to incorporate third-party revenue generating opportunities which will bring efficiency and financial benefits to the scheme and will compliment and provide health and social care integration benefits. The appointed partner may also be offered the opportunity to acquire not more than 10 acres of additional surplus land (which is likely to be adjacent to the main development site and currently forms part of the current Frenchay Hospital site) on a freehold basis which can be used by the development partner to deliver further independent Extra Care Housing development(s) in a manner which is beneficial to the Trust. The opportunity to acquire the additional surplus land (if the Trust decides to incorporate it into the opportunity) will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. The Trust would encourage bidders to incorporate solutions for the surplus land which compliment the development of a health and social care campus and provide some health and social care integration benefits with the Trust’s facilities. The opportunity may also include similar arrangements being provided at a further site in Bristol or South Gloucestershire which is within the Trust’s ownership. This is likely to include new ambulatory care facilities, GP premises and in a nursing home. Should the proposed solution allow, it may be possible to incorporate third-party revenue generating opportunities which will bring efficiency and financial benefits to the scheme and will compliment and provide health and social care integration benefits. The Trust’s requirements, particularly the inclusion of the surplus land and the inclusion of a further development site are still being developed and the Trust’s requirements will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. The Trust reserves the right not to award this opportunity or to award only part (or a different arrangement) of the opportunity described in this OJEU notice. Although it is currently envisaged that the Trust will be the contracting authority conducting this procurement future government guidance, policy, regulation or NHS re-organisation may require a successor body to become the contracting authority to conclude the procurement exercise. This may include among others an NHS Foundation Trust or a central government body."

DSTL require a hand held device for the rapid identification of personnel exposed to ricin and other toxins. Proof of principle for ricin is required initially but subsequent development is likely to be required to deliver a multiplexed capability to enable interrogation of a single sample for the presence of several toxins with a single device. Although alternative technologies with similar capabilities will be considered, the suggested method is an immunoaffinity chromatography column (IACC), incorporating antibodies for capture of ricin immobilized in 3 dimensions on filter frits which are an integral part of the column matrix. Sample (containing toxin) is mixed with an appropriate buffer and run down the column. Toxin present in the sample is captured on the filter frit. A biotinylated detection antibody is then passed down the column and binds to the toxin. A colour then develops on the frit following subsequent addition of a reagent which is insoluble and resides at the site of reaction. The device must be hand held with a maximum volume of 5ml. Through this work program, DSTL wishes to develop bespoke devices using our own antibodies. The analytical method/device must satisfy the following criteria: — Be suitable for reproducibly identifying toxins in complex media with no cross reactivity between toxin types or false positive readings, — Be hand-held and portable, — Be rapid to complete, i.e. ≤ 30 minutes, — Involve minimal sample preparation, — Require minimal operator expertise and training, — Positive results should being indicated by eye, enabling correct interpretation of results by a non-expert, — The ability to utilise portable equipment for qualitative and quantitative assessment of results is also desirable, — Ideally not be dependent on cold chain storage. Most importantly, this test for ricin (and other toxins) will require optimisation through the trialling of a number of antibodies supplied by DSTL to capture and detect the toxin. The work will be conducted incrementally on a task by task basis and optional follow on tasks will be dependant on successful completion of the previous and continuing DSTL requirements. To this end, DSTL is seeking an organisation with a proven track record using the identified technology, to develop, optimise, characterise and provide bespoke immuno-affinity columns for assessment at DSTL. Alternative innovative solutions will also be considered. It is business critical that the organisation can demonstrate prior experience using their proposed technology, to reproducibly identify toxins in complex matrices. In particular, previous experience with detection of ricin in complex matrices is desired. Prototype devices produced must be suitable for further development and manufacture to meet the requirement of European Union CE Marking for use as an in vitro diagnostic medical device. Bidders will be expected to indicate how their proposed device could meet these criteria and how the quality systems used would support further development of the device. There may be a requirement to undertake additional development work if examination of the columns by DSTL indicates that this is required. Stability of the devices and reagents at ambient temperature should also be demonstrated. Provision of additional batches of columns made to the specifications of the tasks may also be required. Placement of any contract will be subject to DSTL’s assessment of evidence provided by candidate organisations. UK Bidders should be aware that ricin is regulated by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and as such its use will require an Open General Licence (OGL) obtainable from the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR). Registration under Schedule 5 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 will also be required. Overseas tenderers will require equivalent national authoritative/regulatory documentation and may require import licences for DSTL antibodies and toxins and shall be responsible for all import/export arrangements."

The provision for this includes the Stats Wales website; a free-to-use public service that allows users to view, manipulate, create and download tables from the most detailed official data on Wales. The website now provides a critical data dissemination service to stakeholder organisations, having a regular (registered) user base of 1500 with an average daily hit rate of 3000. Stats Wales can be found at the following address: http://statswales.wales.gov.uk/index.htm The site has been in use for almost 10 years and the current contract is now due for renewal (summer 2012). A like for like replacement is being sought to provide a service that is fundamentally no different from that currently deployed. However, there is an opportunity to consider additional features common to modern systems so that the replacement may provide an initial move to developing a more integrated approach to public data dissemination. (NB: In the future, the client wishes to standardise and consolidate its approach to public data dissemination, as a response to changing practices in the wider public sector, and in preparation for the potential ""right to data"" legislation. This approach is being addressed as a separate project and is a long-term goal for the client. However, in the short-to-medium-term, the replacement of Stats Wales is the priority). The tendering process seeks responses from the vendor community for a fixed-price proposal for the new Stats Wales service, against which it may enter into a contract with the successful supplier. The Welsh Government, on behalf of the Welsh Ministers, will be conducting this procurement exercise through the etenderwales portal https://etenderwales.bravosolution.co.uk Tender documents and other information must be downloaded from and returned through this portal. If you require any further assistance the BravoSolution helpdesk is available on: Email: help@bravosolution.co.uk. Phone: +44 800 3684850/ Fax: +44 2070600480.

These bodies include but are not limited to Central Government Departments and their Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies, NHS bodies, Local Authorities, Voluntary Sector Charities, and/or other private organisations acting as managing agents or procuring on behalf of these public sector bodies. (see section VI.3, Additional Information). The above public sector bodies have a need for the provision of PSN telecommunications and other services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need, providing innovative telecommunications and other services for the UK public sector as a whole. The services to be made available under the Framework Agreement will include provision of Communications Service, CCTV and Physical Monitoring Services, Conferencing Services, Managed Equipment Room Services, Call/Contact Centre Services, Mobile Voice and data Services, Paging Services, LAN Services, Gateway Services, Unified Services, supporting security, information assurance, design, acquisition, consultancy, and other services as described below. The Framework Agreement will also be suitable for provision of services that require PSN compliance, and for those at lower security levels, that do not require full PSN compliance. Information about the PSN is provided under 'PSN Standards' further down in this section. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. The Contracting Authority considers that this opportunity may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For the avoidance of doubt, the Contracting Authority points out that no weight will be attached to whether or not an economic operator is an SME in selecting economic operators to submit tenders or in assessing the most economically advantageous tender. The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year's duration. The normal duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework is expected to be 5 years with options for 2 annual extensions. The extension options will enable a maximum contract term of 7 years to be exercised only where there is a specific transition or business transformation need to be addressed. Related Procurements. This is one of several related OJEU notices or procurements issued or planned in association with the provision of telecommunications services to the UK public sector as part of a general transition to PSN standards. Others are listed below but do not form part of this OJEU Notice and are mentioned here for information only: — Managed Telecommunications Convergence Framework (MTCF) to provide continuity for the Managed Telecommunications Service (Mts), and convergence to PSN-compliant provision (now in place – OJEU ref 2009-S239-342337), — GSi Convergence Framework (GCF) to provide continuity for the transition of the Government Secure Intranet (GSi), and convergence to PSN-compliant provision (now in place – OJEU ref 2009-S240-343643), — the PSN Connectivity Framework for the provision of PSN connectivity services to the UK Public Sector, — additional sourcing activities for the provision of PSN Central Services, necessary to support the functional operation of the PSN (yet to be started). Services to be provided within this Framework Agreement. The services required to be offered across 10 (ten) Lots. Framework suppliers will be expected to offer all the services listed for each Lot to which they are party either across the UK or on a more localised basis, either directly or through sub-contractors. The detailed services to be delivered will be more fully defined in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) within the broad descriptions below. Lots: 1. Communications Services 2. CCTV and Physical Security Monitoring Services 3. Conferencing Services 4. Managed Equipment Room Services 5. Call/Contact Centre Services 6. Mobile Voice and Data Services 7. Paging Services 8. LAN Services 9. Gateway Services 10. Unified Services Also: 1. Design, Deployment, Transition and Business Continuity services in respect of services provided within this framework, including, but not limited to: 1.1. Planning, specification, design, acquisition, deployment and transition, including the acquisition, integration and management of services from other contractors, acting on behalf of the customer as part of an overall solution; 1.2. Implementation including testing and integration; 1.3. Project and programme management; 1.4. Compatibility planning with legacy systems and technologies; 1.5. Transition from legacy systems and technologies; 1.6. Development, testing and implementation of business continuity plans and infrastructure in support of customers own business continuity plans in respect of the services provided in this framework; 1.7. Exit arrangements and transition to successor services; 1.8. Consultancy and design relating to the services provided under this framework. Common Service Attributes. Framework suppliers will be required to offer the following: — Impact Levels (where relevant). Impact Levels are the UK Government’s standard method of assessing the impact of possible compromises to the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of information throughout the public sector and Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), as mandated by Requirements 11 and 33 of the Security Policy Framework found at: http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/security-policy-framework. They are defined in Business Impact Level Tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at: www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. Throughout this document, where the form “ILx” is used to denote Impact Level, x being an integer between 0 and 4, this means Impact Level x for Confidentiality and Integrity, irrespective of the Impact Level for Availability. Where the form “ILx-yz” is used, this means Impact Level x for Confidentiality, Impact Level y for Integrity and Impact Level z for Availability. Services will be required to operate within a range of Impact Levels up to and including CONFIDENTIAL (IL4) with possible occasional requirement to support applications at higher Impact Levels. The minimum Impact Level for services that will operate with and make full use of PSN central services (which are services essential to support the functional operation of a public services network, including but not necessarily limited to a top level domain name service and public key infrastructure and which are not intended to be purchased through the PSN Services framework agreements) is IL2 and services at that level and above must be assured and accredited to the appropriate level. However, services below IL2, that will not operate with make use of PSN central services, and do not require the corresponding accreditation and assurance, may also be supplied through this framework. The Framework Agreement will need suppliers with the ability to deliver IL2, IL3 and IL4 services meeting PSN standards. Each supplier in this Framework Agreement will need to be capable of supplying PSN-compliant services to at least IL2-2-4. — Business Operations. Services will be required to be provided for a range of business operating regimes including: — 24/7, — public facing with high volumes in business hours, — public facing with out-of-hours event/emergency support for high volumes; and, — business hours only, — Business Continuity. Framework suppliers will be required to offer highly resilient systems supported by business continuity, disaster recovery and rapid deployment services in respect of the services they offer in this framework. — Flexible Billing. Framework suppliers will be required to offer flexible billing options, including split/cost centre billing for shared services. — Service Management. Framework suppliers are expected to be capable of providing fully managed services. Standards and Guidelines. Framework suppliers will be required to comply with the following: — Next Generation Network (NGN) Guidance. Buying Solutions recognises the benefits associated with Next Generation Networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance should be reviewed and complied with where specified by customers at Call Off. It may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be a component part in reducing Contracting Authorities’ carbon footprints, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction in sustainability impacts. In addition, the sustainability of framework suppliers’ sources of supply should be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. — PSN Standards (in relation to provision of services at IL2 and above). The PSN vision is to create a secure Public Services Network constructed from a network of networks built to common standards that enables the delivery of public services from any place by any provider; in doing so it will create a competitive marketplace to significantly reduce the cost of telecommunications services and enable different and creative ways of delivering public services. Bidders are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the PSN concepts, principles, operation and standards, and to participate where appropriate in the PSN industry forums. In particular bidders are strongly advised to read the PSN Operating Model for an overview of the PSN and its operating principles, and to visit the PSN website: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network. Successful bidders will be required to deliver services that comply with the PSN standards, as published by the PSN Authority during the procurement and during the lifetime of the frameworks, provided that any new standards published post award do not materially alter the scope of this OJEU Notice or awarded Framework Agreements. These PSN standards will be developed with industry involvement. The PSN standards are listed on the PSN website, along with other documents and information relating to the PSN. Bidders who require additional information about the PSN, for example how to participate in industry forums, should consult the contacts listed on the PSN website."

Exit arrangements and transition to successor services; 1.8. Consultancy and design relating to the services provided under this framework. Common Service Attributes. Framework suppliers will be required to offer the following: — Impact Levels (where relevant). Impact Levels are the UK Government’s standard method of assessing the impact of possible compromises to the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of information throughout the public sector and Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), as mandated by Requirements 11 and 33 of the Security Policy Framework found at: http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/security-policy-framework. They are defined in Business Impact Level Tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at: www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. Throughout this document, where the form “ILx” is used to denote Impact Level, x being an integer between 0 and 4, this means Impact Level x for Confidentiality and Integrity, irrespective of the Impact Level for Availability. Where the form “ILx-yz” is used, this means Impact Level x for Confidentiality, Impact Level y for Integrity and Impact Level z for Availability. Services will be required to operate within a range of Impact Levels up to and including CONFIDENTIAL (IL4) with possible occasional requirement to support applications at higher Impact Levels. The minimum Impact Level for services that will operate with and make full use of PSN central services (which are services essential to support the functional operation of a public services network, including but not necessarily limited to a top level domain name service and public key infrastructure and which are not intended to be purchased through the PSN Services framework agreements) is IL2 and services at that level and above must be assured and accredited to the appropriate level. However, services below IL2, that will not operate with make use of PSN central services, and do not require the corresponding accreditation and assurance, may also be supplied through this framework. The Framework Agreement will need suppliers with the ability to deliver IL2, IL3 and IL4 services meeting PSN standards. Each supplier in this Framework Agreement will need to be capable of supplying PSN-compliant services to at least IL2-2-4. — Business Operations. Services will be required to be provided for a range of business operating regimes including: — 24/7, — public facing with high volumes in business hours, — public facing with out-of-hours event/emergency support for high volumes; and, — business hours only, — Business Continuity. Framework suppliers will be required to offer highly resilient systems supported by business continuity, disaster recovery and rapid deployment services in respect of the services they offer in this framework. — Flexible Billing. Framework suppliers will be required to offer flexible billing options, including split/cost centre billing for shared services. — Service Management. Framework suppliers are expected to be capable of providing fully managed services. Standards and Guidelines. Framework suppliers will be required to comply with the following: — Next Generation Network (NGN) Guidance. Buying Solutions recognises the benefits associated with Next Generation Networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance should be reviewed and complied with where specified by customers at Call Off. It may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be a component part in reducing Contracting Authorities’ carbon footprints, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction in sustainability impacts. In addition, the sustainability of framework suppliers’ sources of supply should be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. — PSN Standards (in relation to provision of services at IL2 and above). The PSN vision is to create a secure Public Services Network constructed from a network of networks built to common standards that enables the delivery of public services from any place by any provider; in doing so it will create a competitive marketplace to significantly reduce the cost of telecommunications services and enable different and creative ways of delivering public services. Bidders are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the PSN concepts, principles, operation and standards, and to participate where appropriate in the PSN industry forums. In particular bidders are strongly advised to read the PSN Operating Model for an overview of the PSN and its operating principles, and to visit the PSN website: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network. Successful bidders will be required to deliver services that comply with the PSN standards, as published by the PSN Authority during the procurement and during the lifetime of the frameworks, provided that any new standards published post award do not materially alter the scope of this OJEU Notice or awarded Framework Agreements. These PSN standards will be developed with industry involvement. The PSN standards are listed on the PSN website, along with other documents and information relating to the PSN. Bidders who require additional information about the PSN, for example how to participate in industry forums, should consult the contacts listed on the PSN website."

These bodies include but are not limited to Central Government Departments and their Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies, NHS bodies, Local Authorities, Voluntary Sector Charities, and/or other private organisations acting as managing agents or procuring on behalf of these public sector bodies. (see section VI.3, Additional Information). The above public sector bodies have a need for the provision of PSN telecommunications and other services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need, providing innovative telecommunications and other services for the UK public sector as a whole. The services to be made available under the Framework Agreement will include provision of Communications Service, CCTV and Physical Monitoring Services, Conferencing Services, Managed Equipment Room Services, Call/Contact Centre Services, Mobile Voice and data Services, Paging Services, LAN Services, Gateway Services, Unified Services, supporting security, information assurance, design, acquisition, consultancy, and other services as described below. The Framework Agreement will also be suitable for provision of services that require PSN compliance, and for those at lower security levels, that do not require full PSN compliance. Information about the PSN is provided under 'PSN Standards' further down in this section. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. The Contracting Authority considers that this opportunity may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For the avoidance of doubt, the Contracting Authority points out that no weight will be attached to whether or not an economic operator is an SME in selecting economic operators to submit tenders or in assessing the most economically advantageous tender. The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year's duration. The normal duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework is expected to be 5 years with options for 2 annual extensions. The extension options will enable a maximum contract term of 7 years to be exercised only where there is a specific transition or business transformation need to be addressed. Related Procurements.

Services will be required to operate within a range of Impact Levels up to and including CONFIDENTIAL (IL4) with possible occasional requirement to support applications at higher Impact Levels. The minimum Impact Level for services that will operate with and make full use of PSN central services (which are services essential to support the functional operation of a public services network, including but not necessarily limited to a top level domain name service and public key infrastructure and which are not intended to be purchased through the PSN Services framework agreements) is IL2 and services at that level and above must be assured and accredited to the appropriate level. However, services below IL2, that will not operate with make use of PSN central services, and do not require the corresponding accreditation and assurance, may also be supplied through this framework. The Framework Agreement will need suppliers with the ability to deliver IL2, IL3 and IL4 services meeting PSN standards. Each supplier in this Framework Agreement will need to be capable of supplying PSN-compliant services to at least IL2-2-4. — Business Operations. Services will be required to be provided for a range of business operating regimes including: — 24/7, — public facing with high volumes in business hours, — public facing with out-of-hours event/emergency support for high volumes; and, — business hours only, — Business Continuity. Framework suppliers will be required to offer highly resilient systems supported by business continuity, disaster recovery and rapid deployment services in respect of the services they offer in this framework. — Flexible Billing. Framework suppliers will be required to offer flexible billing options, including split/cost centre billing for shared services. — Service Management. Framework suppliers are expected to be capable of providing fully managed services. Standards and Guidelines. Framework suppliers will be required to comply with the following: — Next Generation Network (NGN) Guidance. Buying Solutions recognises the benefits associated with Next Generation Networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance should be reviewed and complied with where specified by customers at Call Off. It may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be a component part in reducing Contracting Authorities’ carbon footprints, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction in sustainability impacts. In addition, the sustainability of framework suppliers’ sources of supply should be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. — PSN Standards (in relation to provision of services at IL2 and above). The PSN vision is to create a secure Public Services Network constructed from a network of networks built to common standards that enables the delivery of public services from any place by any provider; in doing so it will create a competitive marketplace to significantly reduce the cost of telecommunications services and enable different and creative ways of delivering public services. Bidders are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the PSN concepts, principles, operation and standards, and to participate where appropriate in the PSN industry forums. In particular bidders are strongly advised to read the PSN Operating Model for an overview of the PSN and its operating principles, and to visit the PSN website: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network. Successful bidders will be required to deliver services that comply with the PSN standards, as published by the PSN Authority during the procurement and during the lifetime of the frameworks, provided that any new standards published post award do not materially alter the scope of this OJEU Notice or awarded Framework Agreements. These PSN standards will be developed with industry involvement. The PSN standards are listed on the PSN website, along with other documents and information relating to the PSN. Bidders who require additional information about the PSN, for example how to participate in industry forums, should consult the contacts listed on the PSN website."

These bodies include but are not limited to Central Government Departments and their Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies, NHS bodies, Local Authorities, Voluntary Sector Charities, and/or other private organisations acting as managing agents or procuring on behalf of these public sector bodies. (see section VI.3, Additional Information). The above public sector bodies have a need for the provision of PSN telecommunications and other services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need, providing innovative telecommunications and other services for the UK public sector as a whole. The services to be made available under the Framework Agreement will include provision of Communications Service, CCTV and Physical Monitoring Services, Conferencing Services, Managed Equipment Room Services, Call/Contact Centre Services, Mobile Voice and data Services, Paging Services, LAN Services, Gateway Services, Unified Services, supporting security, information assurance, design, acquisition, consultancy, and other services as described below. The Framework Agreement will also be suitable for provision of services that require PSN compliance, and for those at lower security levels, that do not require full PSN compliance. Information about the PSN is provided under 'PSN Standards' further down in this section. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. The Contracting Authority considers that this opportunity may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For the avoidance of doubt, the Contracting Authority points out that no weight will be attached to whether or not an economic operator is an SME in selecting economic operators to submit tenders or in assessing the most economically advantageous tender. The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year's duration. The normal duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework is expected to be 5 years with options for 2 annual extensions. The extension options will enable a maximum contract term of 7 years to be exercised only where there is a specific transition or business transformation need to be addressed. Related Procurements. This is one of several related OJEU notices or procurements issued or planned in association with the provision of telecommunications services to the UK public sector as part of a general transition to PSN standards.

Buying Solutions recognises the benefits associated with Next Generation Networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance should be reviewed and complied with where specified by customers at Call Off. It may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be a component part in reducing Contracting Authorities’ carbon footprints, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction in sustainability impacts. In addition, the sustainability of framework suppliers’ sources of supply should be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. — PSN Standards (in relation to provision of services at IL2 and above). The PSN vision is to create a secure Public Services Network constructed from a network of networks built to common standards that enables the delivery of public services from any place by any provider; in doing so it will create a competitive marketplace to significantly reduce the cost of telecommunications services and enable different and creative ways of delivering public services. Bidders are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the PSN concepts, principles, operation and standards, and to participate where appropriate in the PSN industry forums. In particular bidders are strongly advised to read the PSN Operating Model for an overview of the PSN and its operating principles, and to visit the PSN website: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network. Successful bidders will be required to deliver services that comply with the PSN standards, as published by the PSN Authority during the procurement and during the lifetime of the frameworks, provided that any new standards published post award do not materially alter the scope of this OJEU Notice or awarded Framework Agreements. These PSN standards will be developed with industry involvement. The PSN standards are listed on the PSN website, along with other documents and information relating to the PSN. Bidders who require additional information about the PSN, for example how to participate in industry forums, should consult the contacts listed on the PSN website."

These bodies include but are not limited to Central Government Departments and their Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies, NHS bodies, Local Authorities, Voluntary Sector Charities, and/or other private organisations acting as managing agents or procuring on behalf of these public sector bodies. (see section VI.3, Additional Information). The above public sector bodies have a need for the provision of PSN telecommunications and other services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need, providing innovative telecommunications and other services for the UK public sector as a whole. The services to be made available under the Framework Agreement will include provision of Communications Service, CCTV and Physical Monitoring Services, Conferencing Services, Managed Equipment Room Services, Call/Contact Centre Services, Mobile Voice and data Services, Paging Services, LAN Services, Gateway Services, Unified Services, supporting security, information assurance, design, acquisition, consultancy, and other services as described below. The Framework Agreement will also be suitable for provision of services that require PSN compliance, and for those at lower security levels, that do not require full PSN compliance. Information about the PSN is provided under 'PSN Standards' further down in this section. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. The Contracting Authority considers that this opportunity may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For the avoidance of doubt, the Contracting Authority points out that no weight will be attached to whether or not an economic operator is an SME in selecting economic operators to submit tenders or in assessing the most economically advantageous tender. The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year's duration. The normal duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework is expected to be 5 years with options for 2 annual extensions. The extension options will enable a maximum contract term of 7 years to be exercised only where there is a specific transition or business transformation need to be addressed. Related Procurements. This is one of several related OJEU notices or procurements issued or planned in association with the provision of telecommunications services to the UK public sector as part of a general transition to PSN standards. Others are listed below but do not form part of this OJEU Notice and are mentioned here for information only: — Managed Telecommunications Convergence Framework (MTCF) to provide continuity for the Managed Telecommunications Service (Mts), and convergence to PSN-compliant provision (now in place – OJEU ref 2009-S239-342337), — GSi Convergence Framework (GCF) to provide continuity for the transition of the Government Secure Intranet (GSi), and convergence to PSN-compliant provision (now in place – OJEU ref 2009-S240-343643), — the PSN Connectivity Framework for the provision of PSN connectivity services to the UK Public Sector, — additional sourcing activities for the provision of PSN Central Services, necessary to support the functional operation of the PSN (yet to be started). Services to be provided within this Framework Agreement. The services required to be offered across 10 (ten) Lots. Framework suppliers will be expected to offer all the services listed for each Lot to which they are party either across the UK or on a more localised basis, either directly or through sub-contractors. The detailed services to be delivered will be more fully defined in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) within the broad descriptions below. Lots: 1. Communications Services 2. CCTV and Physical Security Monitoring Services 3. Conferencing Services 4. Managed Equipment Room Services 5. Call/Contact Centre Services 6. Mobile Voice and Data Services 7. Paging Services 8. LAN Services 9. Gateway Services 10. Unified Services Also: 1. Design, Deployment, Transition and Business Continuity services in respect of services provided within this framework, including, but not limited to: 1.1. Planning, specification, design, acquisition, deployment and transition, including the acquisition, integration and management of services from other contractors, acting on behalf of the customer as part of an overall solution; 1.2. Implementation including testing and integration; 1.3. Project and programme management; 1.4. Compatibility planning with legacy systems and technologies; 1.5.

Exit arrangements and transition to successor services; 1.8. Consultancy and design relating to the services provided under this framework. Common Service Attributes. Framework suppliers will be required to offer the following: — Impact Levels (where relevant). Impact Levels are the UK Government’s standard method of assessing the impact of possible compromises to the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of information throughout the public sector and Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), as mandated by Requirements 11 and 33 of the Security Policy Framework found at: http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/security-policy-framework. They are defined in Business Impact Level Tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at: www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. Throughout this document, where the form “ILx” is used to denote Impact Level, x being an integer between 0 and 4, this means Impact Level x for Confidentiality and Integrity, irrespective of the Impact Level for Availability. Where the form “ILx-yz” is used, this means Impact Level x for Confidentiality, Impact Level y for Integrity and Impact Level z for Availability. Services will be required to operate within a range of Impact Levels up to and including CONFIDENTIAL (IL4) with possible occasional requirement to support applications at higher Impact Levels. The minimum Impact Level for services that will operate with and make full use of PSN central services (which are services essential to support the functional operation of a public services network, including but not necessarily limited to a top level domain name service and public key infrastructure and which are not intended to be purchased through the PSN Services framework agreements) is IL2 and services at that level and above must be assured and accredited to the appropriate level. However, services below IL2, that will not operate with make use of PSN central services, and do not require the corresponding accreditation and assurance, may also be supplied through this framework. The Framework Agreement will need suppliers with the ability to deliver IL2, IL3 and IL4 services meeting PSN standards. Each supplier in this Framework Agreement will need to be capable of supplying PSN-compliant services to at least IL2-2-4. — Business Operations. Services will be required to be provided for a range of business operating regimes including: — 24/7, — public facing with high volumes in business hours, — public facing with out-of-hours event/emergency support for high volumes; and, — business hours only, — Business Continuity. Framework suppliers will be required to offer highly resilient systems supported by business continuity, disaster recovery and rapid deployment services in respect of the services they offer in this framework. — Flexible Billing. Framework suppliers will be required to offer flexible billing options, including split/cost centre billing for shared services. — Service Management. Framework suppliers are expected to be capable of providing fully managed services. Standards and Guidelines. Framework suppliers will be required to comply with the following: — Next Generation Network (NGN) Guidance. Buying Solutions recognises the benefits associated with Next Generation Networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance should be reviewed and complied with where specified by customers at Call Off.

Framework suppliers will be required to offer the following: — Impact levels. Impact levels are the UK Government’s standard method of assessing the impact of possible compromises to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information throughout the public sector and Critical national infrastructure (CNI), as mandated by Requirements 11 and 33 of the Security policy framework found at: http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/security-policy-framework They are defined in business impact level tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at: www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. Throughout this document, where the form “ILx” is used to denote impact level, x being an integer between 0 and 4, this means impact level x for confidentiality and integrity, irrespective of the impact level for availability. Where the form “ILx-y-z” is used, this means impact level x for confidentiality, impact level y for integrity and impact level z for availability. Services will be required for a range of impact levels up to and including confidential (IL4) with possible occasional requirement to support applications at higher impact levels. The minimum impact level for services that make full use of PSN central services is IL2 and services at that level and above must be assured and accredited to the appropriate level. However, services below IL2, that will not make use of PSN Central Services, and do not require the corresponding accreditation and assurance, may also be supplied through this framework. The framework agreement will need suppliers with the ability to deliver IL2, IL3 and IL4 services meeting PSN standards. Each supplier in this framework agreement will need to be capable of supplying PSN-compliant services to at least IL2-2-4. — Business operations. Services will be required to be provided for a range of business operating regimes including: — 24/7, — public facing with high volumes in business hours, — public facing with out-of-hours event/emergency support for high volumes; and, — business hours only, — Business continuity. Framework suppliers will be required to offer highly resilient systems supported by business continuity, disaster recovery and rapid deployment services in respect of the services they offer in this framework. — Flexible billing. Framework suppliers will be required to offer flexible billing options, including split/cost centre billing for shared services. — Service management. Framework suppliers are expected to be capable of providing fully managed services. Standards and guidelines. Framework suppliers will be required to comply with the following: — Next generation network (NGN) Guidance. Buying Solutions recognises the benefits associated with Next generation networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement standards project was initiated as part of the Cabinet office’s NGN risk mitigation programme, and the resulting guidance should be reviewed and complied with. It may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be a component part in reducing Contracting Authorities’ carbon footprints, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction in sustainability impacts. In addition, the sustainability of framework suppliers’ sources of supply should be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. — PSN Standards (in relation to provision of services at IL2 and above). The PSN vision is to create a secure Public services network constructed from a network of networks built to common standards that enables the delivery of public services from any place by any provider; in doing so it will create a competitive marketplace to significantly reduce the cost of telecommunications services and enable different and creative ways of delivering public services. Bidders are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the PSN concepts, principles, operation and standards, and to participate where appropriate in the PSN industry forums. In particular bidders are strongly advised to read the PSN Operating Model for an overview of the PSN and its operating principles, and to visit the PSN website: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network Successful suppliers will be required to deliver services that comply with the PSN standards, as published by the PSN Authority during the procurement and during the lifetime of the frameworks, provided that any new standards published post award do not materially alter the scope of this OJEU notice or awarded framework agreements. These PSN standards will be developed with industry involvement. The PSN standards are listed on the PSN website, along with other documents and information relating to the PSN. Bidders who require additional information about the PSN, for example how to participate in industry forums, should consult the contacts listed on the PSN website. Electronic reverse auctions (ERAs). Contracting Authorities may decide to hold an electronic reverse auction on the opening of further competition among the parties to the framework agreement."

The Contracting Authority is seeking to procure on behalf of itself and the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and the City of Westminster (both referred to as “the participating authorities”) an innovative private sector partner to invest in, develop and provide a range of total facilities management services through a strategic partnering arrangement (the ""total FM Contract”) and a separate framework agreement. The Contracting Authority currently envisages that at the end of the procurement process the total FM contract and any framework agreement would be awarded to the successful supplier in its own right. However, the Contracting Authority is interested in exploring with the suppliers that are invited to participate in competitive dialogue what benefits, if any, would be realized by the Contracting Authority on behalf of itself or together with one or more of the participating authorities procuring as part of this procurement a strategic private sector partner with which to form a joint venture company and to which the total FM contract and any framework agreement would be awarded. The Contracting Authority therefore reserves the right as part of the current procurement to procure alongside the delivery of the total FM contract and any framework agreement, a partner with which to form a joint venture company or not to pursue this route further at the Contracting Authority’s discretion. The Contracting Authority and the participating authorities shall consider during the procurement process the structure of the client entity that it is anticipated will enter into the total FM contract and any framework agreement with the supplier and are currently giving consideration to the following options: (1) The Contracting Authority and the Participating authorities establish a wholly owned non-trading company (such as a Teckal company) which may in time convert into a trading company; or (2) The Contracting Authority enters into the total FM contract and any framework agreement on behalf of itself and the participating authorities; or (3) The Contracting Authority and the participating authorities enter into the total FM contract and any framework agreement. The above list is not an exhaustive list of options and the Contracting Authority reserves the right to consider alternative options and not to proceed with any of the options stated above. The principal outputs of the total FM contract will be to: — Deliver to specified performance levels, — Achieve efficiencies, — Deriving the benefits of a shared service model for the users of council services, — Provide value for money and accountable services from a customer perspective, — Reduce revenue costs in supporting the delivery of front-line services wherever possible, — Deliver continuous improvement and innovation in respect of these services. It is anticipated that the core requirements that may be included in the total FM contract will comprise the following: Hard Facilities Management including reactive repairs; maintenance; minor capital works; mechanical & electrical maintenance; re-lamping; fire detection and fighting systems; lifts, hoists and conveying systems; security, access and intruder systems; safety film; standby power systems maintenance; audio-visual equipment maintenance; television cabling; hard landscaping maintenance; soft landscaping maintenance; ponds and water features; internal planting; cut flowers; control of asbestos; water hygiene; statutory inspections; portable appliance testing; Building Management Systems (BMS); locksmith services; clocks; furniture management; signage. Soft facilities management services including catering; room bookings and community lettings; display boards; routine, periodic and reactive cleaning; cleaning of external areas; window cleaning; cleaning of exterior building fabric; graffiti and stain removal; sanitary consumables; linen and laundry; pest control; waste management; reception services; security services; mail services; messenger service; porterage; stationery supply; journal, magazine and newspaper supply; reprographics service. Managed services including health and safety management; authorized persons and permits to work; special needs services; risk management; environmental management; business continuity planning. Helpdesk and Computer Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) including helpdesk and CAFM; room bookings and lettings management; car park booking. Management and administration including performance monitoring; key performance indicators; contract management; quality approach; management of sub-contractors; Electronic Property Information Mapping System (ePIMS). The intention of the Contracting Authority and the participating authorities is that property management IT services such as maintaining the asset register, commercial lettings and project management are in scope for this procurement but the Contracting Authority and the participating authorities may review this during the procurement and decide not to proceed with the procurement of these services. This list is not exhaustive and consideration may be given both during the procurement process and the contract term to the inclusion of additional services or options for additional services which will assist in delivering the services and principal outputs listed above. The Contracting Authority intends to make the services delivered under the total FM contract available to schools maintained by the Contracting Authority and the participating authorities although the said schools shall not be under any obligation to use the total FM contract. The Contracting Authority wishes to enable other local authorities in addition to the participating authorities to benefit from this procurement. As such, in addition to the total FM contract the Contracting Authority is seeking to procure a separate framework agreement for call-offs by all local authorities and schools (maintained through public funds) in Greater London (the ""participating bodies""). A list of the participating districts can be found at http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/london-boroughs/list-boroughs. The Contracting Authority is acting as a central purchasing body through which the participating bodies and schools (maintained through public funds) may wish to procure substantially similar services to those included in the total FM contract under a separate framework agreement but without any obligation on the participating bodies and the said schools to participate. Accordingly it is the intention that the participating bodies and the said schools should be able to rely on this procurement to purchase such services without the need for any further procurement process. The duration of an individual call-off contract under any framework agreement will not necessarily be limited to four years but will be governed by the subject matter of the call-off contract concerned. The form of the call-off contract will be agreed during the current procurement process subject to the right to make specific amendments in respect of an individual call-off. It is anticipated that services delivered under the total FM contract will commence in May 2013. The Contracting Authority envisages entering into any framework agreement at the same time as the total FM contract although the timing of any call-offs under the framework agreement will be a matter to be decided between the relevant participating body and the supplier. No guarantee or warranty is given as to the nature or volume, if any, of the services or the number of call-offs, if any, under any framework agreement. It should also be noted that in addition to any change in the structure of the client role as referred to in paragraphs 3 to 5 above, in the event of re-structuring within local government this procurement and / or the total FM contract and any framework agreement awarded will pass to successor authorities to the Contracting Authority, the participating authorities and the participating bodies as relevant and appropriate. The Contracting Authority reserves the right to award only the total FM contract and not to award any framework agreement or alternatively for the total FM contract and any framework agreement to commence on different dates."

In 2008, The Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Health Community (hereafter known as the “LLR”) formally agreed to transform healthcare in order to benefit the quality of life of the population served whilst delivering significant cost improvement. Spend on assets and estate infrastructure is one of the top three areas of expenditure for the LLR. Accordingly it is a priority area for efficiency improvement and transformation. LLR currently provides services across a geographical area of 1 000 square miles. The LLR currently has a multiplicity of delivery models with over 800 directly employed staff delivering its in-house FM services and a similar number of contracted staff employed by the external FM suppliers. The current property portfolio is extensive and identifies more than 850 discrete facilities (including NHS owned, leased and 3rd party property). NHS owned or leased property currently covers a space footprint of circa 496 000 m2. A recent space occupancy review identified an overall level of occupancy of less than 60 %. Options for significant space reduction are currently under development. Flexibility in solution design to meet strategic fit will therefore be critical to success. We are also seeking a partner who can help transform the use of the redesigned estate in support of our clinical strategy. In this context the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust (“The Host Trust”) together with a minimum of two organisations within the East Midlands region have agreed to move to an ‘all shared’ model of delivery and management for FM. The solution will be procured and performance managed by UHL on behalf of the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Facilities Management Collaborative hereafter known as the “LLRFMC”.

Formed in 1999, DGfL has delivered a fully managed service to 110 schools in and around the Dudley Metropolitan Borough through a PFI contract. The current extended contract (DGfL2) will come to an end in January 2011 and subsequently the contracting authority is seeking an innovative private sector partner or partners to provide a new managed service for educational ICT in association with Dudley Grid for Learning 3 (DGfL3). It is proposed that DGfL3 be tailored in such a way that it will provide flexible, affordable options to all schools in the borough who wish to take the service, but also support the Primary and other capital build programmes and be procured in such a way that it would be capable of being an approach to the ICT managed service component of any future inclusion by Dudley MBC in and any participation by it in the BSF programme. Teaching, learning & e-leadership are key areas, the DGfL3 programme is envisaged to support the further development of these areas in schools and other learning locations. These areas are essential pre-requisites to foster innovation and to drive the step change in provision and outcomes required from DGfL3 to deliver the ICT component of Dudley's ""Vision 2025"". To achieve this, the ICT managed service provider is expected to assist and support DGfL3 in providing inspirational learning environments. Dudley MBC is not able to guarantee any particular level of participation from schools nor whether it will participate in or include the ICT managed service wholly or partially in any BSF programme; this will depend on the quality, flexibility and innovation of the offering provided by the successful bidder. The ICT Managed Service Provider will be expected to deliver their proposed service to strict KPI's based around measures including: service availability, educational impact and service usage. The ICT managed service provider is also required to provide and/or manage existing, inter alia, the following services as part of its service delivery: (a) Network infrastructure, hardware, educational and curriculum software titles, schools information management systems (IMS) including the support and training to use these systems, helpdesk, and network and technical support; (b) Programme management services for the full integration of ICT provision in new and refurbished buildings; (c) Project development services throughout the whole programme; (d) Assistance in the Development of Learning Technologies to champion Dudley's 'Vision 2025' in support of educational transformation; (e) The WAN and internet services may be included in the procurement and the MSP should explore the Dudley Corporate ICT Services potential for shared WAN services and internet. Dudley reserves the right to remove this element from the procurement process; (f) Ensure the affordability, availability and sustainability of the proposed ICT solutions, delivering value for money for the local authority and all users; (g) Confirm the technical feasibility of the proposed ICT solutions ensuring that these are sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all users; (h) Propose, develop and operate a scheme enabling those learners who so wish to have access to affordable individual personal learning devices.

TDV is not required to do this under the UK and EU rules governing public procurement since the estimated contract value of the proposed contract falls under the financial threshold for application of the EU and UK procurement rules for a works contract. TDV has structured this procurement in line with the general principles of EU law, but is not bound by any of the other EU or UK rules concerning public procurement. TDV is not intending to be contractually bound in any way, nonetheless, TDV intends to be transparent and to run the procedure as outlined in this contract notice and the tender documents. TDV has accordingly stated, for convenience only, in section IV.1.1 of this contract notice that the procurement will be run under the open procedure. TDV intends to model the procurement of this contract opportunity on the open procedure, but will only be bound by the specific rules contained in the EU and UK rules concerning public procurement regarding the open procedure to the extent set out in this contract notice and the tender documents. (2) The Tremough Development Vehicle Limited (""TDV"") is indirectly a 50:50 joint venture company of the University of Exeter (""UoE"") and the University College Falmouth (""UCF""). The Tremough Campus in Penryn, near Falmouth, is shared by UoE and UCF and TDV is responsible for building developments on the campus and managing all live construction projects. (3) The development of the Tremough Campus since 2004 has involved the procurement and construction of a major 17 000 square metre (approximately) main campus academic building, a further academic building of approximately 6 500 square metres and residences to accommodate over 1,200 students on campus, as well as some refurbishments of existing buildings on the Tremough Campus. (4) Further EU Convergence Funded works are now planned, to create specialist research facilities together with expanded student learning resources. Overall, numbers of undergraduate and postgraduate students on the Tremough Campus are expected to grow to around 5 000 students for the combined total for UoE and UCF by 2016. (5) Four major new projects are being or are to be undertaken in order to cater for this expansion of student numbers. These are: the Academy for Innovation and Research (""AIR""); the Environment and Sustainability Institute (""ESI""); the Exchange Project (""Exchange""); and the Performance Centre (and associated infrastructure works relating to each building). Procurement of a contractor or contractors for the design and construction of these four projects is not the subject of this contract notice (and have been, or are being, separately procured in a separate contract notice). (6) The purpose of this contract notice is to procure a contractor to design and construct various new enabling works on the Tremough Campus to enable the construction of AIR, ESI and Exchange. The enabling works will also include works to comply with conditions within the planning consent for the Performance Centre. (7) TDV wishes to procure a contractor to design and construct various new enabling works on the Tremough Campus to enable the construction of AIR, ESI and Exchange (the “basic contract”). Further, TDV also wishes the same chosen contractor to be able to perform some “Option” enabling works should there be sufficient funding available to permit them.

TDV is not required to do this under the UK and EU rules governing public procurement since the estimated contract value of the proposed contract falls under the financial threshold for application of the EU and UK procurement rules for a works contract. TDV has structured this procurement in line with the general principles of EU law, but is not bound by any of the other EU or UK rules concerning public procurement. TDV is not intending to be contractually bound in any way, nonetheless, TDV intends to be transparent and to run the procedure as outlined in this contract notice and the tender documents. TDV has accordingly stated, for convenience only, in section IV.1.1 of this contract notice that the procurement will be run under the open procedure.

ESPO has been engaged by Cambridgeshire County Council and Suffolk County Council to assist in a procurement process to identify and appoint a library management system provider for each authority (the new systems becoming operational on 1 April 2012). Cambridgeshire County Council and Suffolk County Council are both members of Spine – Shared Partnership IN the East. This is an organisation comprising a number of library authorities in the east region whose aim is to promote joint working wherever practicable in order to maximise operational efficiencies, share resources and pool expertise. In this present instance, the councils are acting within the Spine framework to conduct a collaborative procurement exercise on the basis that ideally a single LMS solution will be selected. However Spine will not itself enter into any contracts as a result of the tender process – contracts will be formally awarded by or on behalf of each individual authority. While it is likely both council’s requirements will be awarded to a single supplier, the right is reserved to make a separate award for each council should it not be in their best interest to proceed with the same supplier. Suppliers should note that supplementary to the above, ESPO is also conducting a procurement exercise to establish a framework agreement with one or several suppliers to provide library management system solutions to local authorities within the UK.

The Authority is seeking to procure 2 high volume document scanners to replace those currently used in the NHS Wales Prescribing Services Unit (PSU) and NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS). The Authority is also seeking to procure associated maintenance/support for hte period of 3 years for such document scanners. The scanners support the live NHS Wales Prescription Pricing Service and are instrumental in meeting monthly production demands of NHS Wales. The scanners are required to support the future development of the PSU service and in particular in order to further automate the pricing data entry systems. PSU is responsible for the capture of data from all community dispensed prescriptions in Wales in order to calculate the remuneration due to dispensing contractors with an NHS dispensing contract. PSU also provides management information on volume and cost prescription items for budgeting, planning and clinical governance purposes. A key stage in the data capture process is the capture of a digital image of each of on average 2 900 000 prescription forms submitted for processing every month. Images are captured and retained for the following purposes: 1. To facilitate further automated data capture by intelligent character recognition (ICR) in order to pre-populate systems and reduce the human resource requirement; 2. To provide streamlined and more efficient paperless workflow through the manual data capture environment by allowing operators to key data from the captured image rather than the paper document; 3. To facilitate an automated retention and retrieval system. This provides a significant increase in archive capacity (6 years for images versus 6 months for paper) for introduction of further E-services within the unit. By having real time access to information with direct links to prescription images these services offer opportunities to increase efficiency of operation within and between internal and external stakeholder organisations for performance management, clinical governance and legal purposes. Lot 2. Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Local Health Board (acting as hosts of Welsh Health Supplies) and in collaboration with the Authority is seeking to procure the supply, delivery, implementation, integration and support of two desktop document scanners (along with any associated other hardware) capable of intelligently scanning invoices and interfacing with Oracle Financials software."

The success of Go-Ahead is based on continuing improvements to the current range of services to improve customer satisfaction and provide passengers with a greater choice of destinations, journey times and methods of planning and booking tickets bus Division. The bus industry is central in the UK's public transport infrastructure and the continued growth of the Go Ahead group. Each year, two thirds of all UK public transport journeys - 4.6 billion - are made by bus, and nine out of ten people live within seven minutes of a bus stop. This makes the bus the near-universally accessible starting point for public transport journeys. It's also where the Go-Ahead Group started in the late 1980s following the deregulation and privatisation of the UK bus industry. Today we have bus companies throughout the country with particular expertise in heavily congested urban areas. Bus travel will be critical to a more integrated, more effective public transport infrastructure in the UK. Our initiatives to increase the number of bus journeys include investment in new technology, ongoing partnerships with stakeholder organisations and better integration with other modes of transport, especially rail contract description. This contract is for the Provision of Planned and Reactive CCTV Maintenance to two Go-AHead Group operating companies. The contract will be for a period of 3 years."

Any public sector or not-for-profit organisation is eligible to join the LUPC as an associate member and, as such, may be granted access to this Framework Agreement, at the discretion of the LUPC. In inviting expressions of interest to tender for the provision of library general supplies, the LUPC is acting as a lead organisation on behalf of the following regional purchasing consortia in England, Wales and Scotland: — Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium (SUPC): http://www.supc.ac.uk, — North West Universities Purchasing Consortium (NWUPC): http://nwupc.procureweb.ac.uk, — North Eastern Universities Purchasing Consortium (NEUPC): http://neupc.procureweb.ac.uk, — Advanced Procurement for Universities and Colleges (APUC): http://www.apuc-scot.ac.uk, — Higher Education Purchasing Consortium, Wales (HEPCW): http://hepcw.procureweb.ac.uk.

The principle behind the Framework Agreement is that it shall not in itself constitute a contract, but will establish a structure by which orders may be placed by participating institutions, each forming a separate contract under the terms and conditions set out in the Framework Agreement. Any agreement resulting from this exercise will be on a non-mandatory basis and as such the LUPC cannot give any guarantee of the level of business which will accrue. However, the successful supplier will become the LUPC nominated supplier to the sector and their products will be promoted via the participating Member institutions and libraries. The LUPC and other regional purchasing consortia membership may be subject to change due to strategic realignment or the inclusion of new affiliated members, including other public sector and non-for-profit organisations."

In terms of the contractual structure, the private sector partner or partners will participate and invest in a new private partnership vehicle (a ""local education partnership"" or ""LEP"") to be established jointly with some or all the contracting authorities. The partnering services will include (but will not be limited to) the development and delivery of a strategic investment programme for: (a) educational facilities; (b) other community facilities which may or may not be integrated or co-located with such educational facilities and which may include (but will not be limited to) the development and delivery of facilities for health, social care, youth services, other small to medium sized projects such as small community park(s), job training centres, care homes, housing (some of which may fall within the authorities’ regeneration projects) and; (c) any other facilities to be provided by one or more of the contracting authorities in the exercise of the powers contained in Section 2(1) of the Local Government Act 2000 (together the ""relevant facilities"") in the contracting authorities area. These partnering services may also comprise of the following services: (a) strategy advisory services; (b) programme management services; (c) project development services; (d) procurement consultancy services; (e) property and estates management services; and (f) procurement and delivery or management of all services required to deliver the strategic investment programme for the relevant facilities (including through the provision, integration and management of supply chain arrangements). It is anticipated that such services may include: (i) architectural services; (ii) engineering services; (iii) construction services; (iv) technical services; (v) building services; (vi) hard facilities management services; (vii) soft facilities management services; (viii) information communication and technology (""ICT"") services; (ix) educational support services; (x) education programme development services; (xi) educational strategy services; for a period of up to 15 years. The relevant facilities, which may be a mixture of new build and refurbished facilities, will be delivered under the private finance initiative (PFI) and/or design and build arrangements. This may include the delivery of the relevant facilities through separate SPVs established by the LEP. Where an SPV is established, the shareholders in such SPV may include the LEP, third party equity providers and supply chain members. The contracting authorities may contract directly with the LEP or where an SPV is established, with the SPV. The regeneration of the secondary school estate and the transformation of secondary education will be the first priority of the LEP. It is also envisaged that the LEP may also take a similar role in future modernisation arrangements for the primary school estate or other community or co located services with other Contracting Authorities particularly on joint use campus sites. Where the authorities existing arrangements are either transferred, expire or where there is a requirement to supplement them [irrespective of whether the facilities are being delivered or refurbished through the LEP], the LEP may also be required to provide for, or arrange for the provision (through supply chain arrangements) of, the management and/or integration of the partnering services, design and build and construction contracts, facilities management services, support services and ICT services (this list is not exhaustive). In particular, the LEP may be required to provide managed ICT services to all primary schools, secondary schools and special schools within the borough. The LEP may also be required to provide property and estates management services in relation to the relevant facilities (and other related properties) for the contracting authorities which may include managing third-party lettings arrangements. These services may be required to be delivered through participation in existing arrangements, through the LEP or through the establishment of a new SPV. The initial schemes for Building Schools for the Future programme at Rotherham will be delivered in two phases and will include 10 of the Borough’s secondary schools and 2 special schools. The first phase is expected to include two sample schools, one of which will be an Academy, and three other schools, all of which will be PFI schools. It will also encompass the co-location of a special school and two amalgamated junior schools on the Academy site. ICT projects will also be required to be delivered under the first phase at two further special schools. The second phase is expected to comprise five schools. Two of these will be PFI schools and a special school is to be co-located on the site of one of these. The remaining three schools will involve Design and Build refurbishment. ICT only will be required to be delivered under the second phase at a further special school. Funding for the second phase (and subsequent phases) will be subject to future decisions by PfS and DfE. It is envisaged that there will be a third phase, which will involve approximately 6 schools in Rotherham that are the subject of an existing PFI scheme and an ICT only Special School. This phase may form part of the Building Schools for the Future Programme and may involve the provision of additional works and services to schools including (but not limited to) ICT and FM. The contracting authorities reserve the right not to award the opportunity, or to award only part of the opportunity, or to vary the final configuration and content of the opportunity described in this notice."

The QCF is a new framework for recognising and accrediting qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The framework is at the heart of a major reform of the vocational qualifications system designed to make the whole system simpler to understand, use and be more inclusive. It does this by awarding credit for qualifications and units. The QCF will enable people to gain qualifications at their own pace along flexible routes. The intention is to make both the system and the qualifications offered far more relevant to the needs of employers and more flexible and accessible for learners. The Framework will be structured so that contracts can be called off separately under each Lot. Service providers will be appointed to each Lot on the basis of criteria designed to test their capabilities and proposed solutions for that Lot. This structure may result in a situation where under the Framework some service providers are appointed to only one Lot whilst others are appointed to two or more Lots. Where the Contracting Authority wishes to call-off contracts for work packages and, to do so, proposes to run parallel mini-competitions under more than one Lot, the Contracting Authority may permit service providers who have been appointed to more than one Lot to submit alternative tenders on the basis of (a) stand-alone tenders for each Lot and (b) a combined tender for 2 or more Lots."

The services to be made available under the framework agreement will include network, email, application, web, hosting, security, data and information sharing including portals and remote presentation services, plus associated design, consultancy and other professional and supporting services. Services will be required to be provided for a range of impact levels up to and including 4,4,4, with possible occasional requirement for applications at higher levels. Impact levels are defined in business impact level tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. The framework agreement will enable customers to call off services to provide continuity for the Government Secure Intranet service (GSi). The GSi is part of UK Critical National Infrastructure, managed by Buying Solutions and supported by the Cabinet Office and CESG. The secure network and community of secure services operating over it that are created through procurements made via this framework agreement are referred to in this document as the “Secure Intranet”. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. The duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework will be the subject of discussion at later procurement stages, but in any event will not exceed 4 years. Related procurements.

The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be key in reducing customers’ carbon footprint, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction. In addition, the sustainability of contractors’ sources of supply will be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. — Public sector network (PSN). The UK PSN is a developing concept of interoperating services creating the effect of a single network. The standards will govern both interconnection of service provider networks and the relevant key service characteristics/attributes that ensure interoperability and end-to-end service assurance. To the extent practicable given the state of development of the PSN standards at the time of issuing the invitation to participate in dialogue, suppliers who are invited to dialogue will be required to take those standards into account in preparing their proposals with a view to ensuring a smooth transition to PSN-compliant services across the UK public sector. Buying Solutions may decide, however, not to include any such requirement in the invitation to participate in dialogue.

The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. [Note: this wording is slightly more specific than the wording in the draft PSNS OJEU notice but it remains doubtful whether it would be sufficient to permit extensive use of the framework overseas especially since there is no assessment of overseas coverage. Perhaps a minor point since UK authorities with overseas premises will be able to use the Echo framework in any event]. The duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework will be the subject of discussion at later procurement stages, but in any event will not exceed 4 years. Related Procurements.

The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be key in reducing customers’ carbon footprint, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction. In addition, the sustainability of contractors’ sources of supply will be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. Public Sector Network (PSN). The UK PSN is a developing concept of interoperating services creating the effect of a single network. The standards will govern both interconnection of service provider networks and the relevant key service characteristics/attributes that ensure interoperability and end-to-end service assurance. To the extent practicable given the state of development of the PSN standards at the time of issuing the invitation to participate in dialogue, suppliers who are invited to dialogue will be required to take those standards into account in preparing their proposals with a view to ensuring a smooth transition to PSN-compliant services across the UK public sector. Buying Solutions may decide, however, not to include any such requirement in the invitation to participate in dialogue.

The above Public Sector Bodies have a need for the provision of managed telecommunications services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need. The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year’s duration. The services to be made available under the Framework Agreement will include voice, video, unified communications and network services, plus associated design, consultancy and other professional and supporting services. Services will be required to be provided for a range of Impact Levels up to and including 3,3,4, with possible occasional requirement for applications at higher levels. Impact Levels are defined in Business Impact Level Tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the Framework Agreement, Buying Solutions intends to hold one or more further competitions with the Framework Suppliers to award call-off contract(s) to replace the Managed Telecommunications Service (Mts), a service managed by Buying Solutions that provides managed telecommunications solutions for the public sector. Other customers (and Buying Solutions) may call-off additional contracts under this Framework Agreement. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites.

The duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework will be the subject of discussion at later procurement stages, but in any event will not exceed 4 years. Related Procurements.

"2009/S 237-339837","331465-2010","Security services","Contract notice",2010,"Short description of the contract or purchase(s)","Leicestershire County Council is planning to replace an in-house bespoke Adult Social Care (ASC) Case Management system (hardware and software), with a package solution. The solution/supplier will: 1) support an excellent-rated Adult Social Care department to carry out its day to day operations in an effective and efficient manner and to support the demands of the changing National Personalisation Agenda; 2) be installed, configured, tested, provide data migration services (if necessary), provide business change consultancy (if required), be signed off for acceptance and provide the ongoing maintenance and support; 3) have the capability to integrate with internal systems namely, but not restricted to, Oracle eBusiness Suite R12 (financials, CRM) and Wisdom EDRMS; 4) have the capability to integrate with external systems (e.g. NHS bodies, GPs, primary care trusts, police, other local authorities, third sector systems) to take advantage of potential partnership projects with external agencies and provide an integrated customer portal that allows service users to self-service; 5) provide the relevant level of training where deemed appropriate. Other considerations: 1) The Council is exploring opportunities to deliver shared services through this procurement. An option is therefore required (which also includes the right to grant sub-licences) that will allow the Council to deliver the functionality of any procured solution to other local authorities and public bodies (including NHS) within the East Midlands Region to maximise the opportunities from any investments and to deliver an overall cost effective service/solution that is flexible and scalable to meet the shared services agenda and changing needs. 2) Market testing for the Adults requirement has revealed that a single solution may be capable of delivering an Adult and Children's solution. Whilst the Council already has a Children's solution (contract expires Autumn 2015), the Council's long term vision is to rationalise and standardise solutions, if at all possible. This procurement exercise will therefore have an option to deploy and/or migrate the Children's component at a later date, if appropriate, in the most cost effective manner. 3) Whilst the Council currently has an in-house solution this procurement exercise will include an alternative option for an offsite hosted solution/service. Due to the complex and long term nature of this procurement the Council is looking for a strategic partner that is experienced, knowledgeable and can assist and guide the Council to meet its aims and long term objectives. Contract Period. Interested bidders should note that, subject to the comments below, the contract term will be for a period of 7 years (this includes up to an estimated 2 year implementation and migration period) with an option to extend for a further 10 years on an annual or multiple year basis taking the contract term to a maximum of 17 years. Leicestershire County Council anticipate the following: 1. The Contract shall become effective upon the date on which the Agreement is signed. Following this there shall be an initial period of two years or sooner, to allow the implementation, migration, testing and acceptance of the solution. 2. Upon satisfactory and successful completion of the migration, implementation, testing and acceptance of the solution the contract term of 5 years shall immediately commence, including Support and Maintenance of the whole solution. 3. Upon expiry of the said contract term of 5 years the Council will have an option to extend the contract, including Support and Maintenance, on an annual or multiple years basis, up to a maximum period or periods not exceeding ten (10) years in total. Duration of the Contract - up to 17 years including the initial period to enable successful migration and implementation and the extension options.

The scope of the services includes the management, maintenance, and operation of all five prisons as well as the delivery of programmes to reduce re-offending. The works element is limited to HMP Wellingborough and includes the demolition of and construction of secure accommodation and ancillaries. The services and works for HMP Wellingborough could potentially be procured through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) using the design, build and operate model. It is anticipated that a separate funding competition will be arranged by the winning bidder. However, the Authority reserves the right to consider alternative funding and contractual strategies including, without limitation, a capital injection by the Authority whether funded by borrowing or otherwise. A requirement of the PFI is that the contract documents are compliant with HM Treasury (United Kingdom government) requirements on the standardisation of PFI contracts. Healthcare and education may be commissioned under this competition but most likely they will be commissioned separately by the relevant Primary Care Trust and Learning and Skills Council. The providers of the custodial services and works will be expected to interface with the health care and education providers to facilitate their delivery, for example, by ensuring prisoners are made available on a timely basis. Interested parties ('Potential Providers') should note that the Authority’s in-house bid unit (public sector) may bid for one or more of the lots subject to this competition. Potential Providers should refer to the Authority’s document called ‘Principles of Competition’ which is available to download as one of the documents related to the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)."

Only a limited number of services and users will participate in the first phase of the project, however, any system selected will form the basis of a corporate system. And should therefore be a scalable product. Whilst the key functionality required is related to the area of employee time and attendance monitoring, any system selected should have additional modular functionality covering, for example, the areas of: Timesheets, Building access control, Resource scheduling; This additional functionality would be implemented as required by services and it is therefore possible that each module would have a different number of users e.g not all users of time and attendance would require to complete timesheets.

The MBChB 2010 curriculum for teaching undergraduate medicine at the University of Leeds will introduce a rolling programme of mobile learning and assessment for all undergraduate students of medicine over the five years of the MBChB curriculum. This will be based on the experience of ALPS CETL www.ALPS-CETL.ac.uk in mobile learning and assessment and will aim to embed key outcomes of ALPS where appropriate in to the teaching of medicine. Over the past 2 years some medicine students have engaged with mobile learning both through ALPS and through work with the miniCEX assessment and the Digital Storytelling projects (ELP2 and Reflect 2.0). During the next session the School of Medicine will introduce mobile learning and assessment to the MBChB through a transition plan which will take us to the full solution for the new MBChB 2010 curriculum. This will introduce mobile devices to all Year 5 students and will develop and implement appropriate content for the mobile device. The purpose of this notice is to outline the areas where the School of Medicine wish to make purchases/leases and to invite potential suppliers to submit expressions of interest in providing solutions in some or all of the areas. This will be a 5 year project and part of the evaluation of any responses will be a willingness of any supplier to engage in a long term (5 year) relationship with the School of Medicine in the implementation of mobile learning and assessment for the teaching of undergraduate medicine. We recognise that products will change over this period and we expect that the outcome will be a framework of products which can be replaced as new offerings become available."

The Relevant Facilities, which may be a mixture of new build and refurbished facilities, will be delivered under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and/or design and build arrangements. This may include the delivery of the Relevant Facilities through separate SPVs established by the LEP. Where an SPV is established, the shareholders in such SPV may include the LEP, third party equity providers and supply chain members. The contracting authorities may contract directly with the LEP or where an SPV is established, with the SPV.

The LEP may take on a wider role in providing professional development activity for ICT and transformational learning initiatives, including the whole of Oldham's secondary school estates. The contracting authorities will require the provision of ICT services and equipment to non-BSF secondary schools (including, potentially, the Radclyffe and Failsworth existing PFI schools), and the provision of an interim ICT managed service for Oldham's secondary schools from the beginning of the contract. There will also be a requirement for an ICT managed service being offered to Oldham's primary schools which those schools will then be able to choose whether to take. The contracting authorities are likely to require a range of services which assist them in delivering the local authority wide requirements including hosting key ICT systems across the secondary and primary school estate. In addition, there may be a requirement for Learning Platform provision in relation to learners aged 13-19 in full or part time education otherwise than at secondary school. In relation to the proposed Academies, there is likely to be an opportunity for the LEP to provide some or all of the Academies' requirements in relation to the provision of ICT/ICT managed services. The LEP will have exclusivity for all hard and soft FM in the BSF PFI schools (except catering) and, subject to confirmation, a minimum of statutory maintenance in the BSF Design and Build Schools. There may be an opportunity for the LEP to provide catering in the PFI schools. The contracting authorities are likely to include 2 sample school schemes within phase 1, which include North Chadderton School (D&B Refurbishment) and Oldham RC School (PFI). It is expected that the LEP will have exclusivity (on terms to be set out in the contract documentation) for Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council's secondary school estate, with the exception of Radclyffe and Failsworth (existing PFI schools) and the proposed Academies. The contracting authorities may require the LEP to deliver other local authority building requirements in its administrative area in respect of the construction and management of leisure and/or health facilities for schools and/or children's services. It is anticipated that other related education projects may include Further Education initiatives or projects within the Primary Capital Programme.

The key drivers are to address the following key challenges, associated with data management: — Archiving, — Data Protection, — Replication, — Data Search & Retrieval, — Planning Data Resources, — Security and Encryption. Development of tools and process to ensure optimum use of storage technologies and operational resources. The development and planning of a data management strategy is of paramount importance if the Trust is to priorities data and ensure an excellent service is delivered throughout the organization while not compromising the performance of systems or the ability to recover in the event of loss of data or hardware or software failure. The data management strategy will also incorporate flexibility and enable the Trust to meet both regulatory and compliance targets, such as supporting bespoke data retention policies and meeting requests associated with the Freedom of Information act. — Archiving, — There are benefits to the patients, Trust and staff will be that no files containing personal/patient data will be held on hard drives on desktop or laptop computers, so meeting DoH guidelines on data encryption in case one of the 3,500 computers in the Trust is lost or stolen. All computers will have their hard drives locked down to prevent files being saved to a local hard drive - centralized storage will be used instead. This will increase the amount of files held centrally and the size of daily backups will therefore increase substantially. By purchasing this software, there will be huge reductions in the number of duplicate files being stored on Trust storage infrastructure. Single Instance Storage ensures that numerous instances of the same file are compiled into one instance. The software will automatically move files and emails over a certain age onto slower and cheaper disk storage designed for the long term archive of data, which is more cost effective but ensures that data can still be referenced online but at slightly reduced speed. This will then reduce the size and length of time the daily backups take, as only files that have been referenced recently will be backed up. The unreferenced data will only need to be backed up once as it will be replicated to a second site to ensure a copy is always available, even in the event of a disaster at the primary computer room. If an archived file is retrieved and modified, it will then automatically be moved to back to the primary disk storage. A retention policy can be defined to ensure that information is treated according to DoH guidelines and, if required, deleted when the retention period expires. — This development will meet the Department of Health instructions on the security of data by ensuring that data is held in secure server rooms. File & Archiving software to ensure optimum use of storage technologies and operational resources. It is envisaged that the solution will automatically move files and emails over a certain age onto slower and cheaper disk storage designed for the long term archive of data.

"2008/S 194-257092","257092-2008","Radar detectors","Contract notice",2008,"Short description of the contract or purchase(s):","The UK MoD has under consideration the replacement of the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) Interrogators as fitted to up to nine Royal Navy (RN) surface ships, in order to meet the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) mandate that all IFF/SSR interrogators must have a Mode S capability in order to gain a licence to operate post 31 December 2011. The replacement IFF Interrogator is to be a Military Off The Shelf (MOTS) item, compliant with both International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requirements and STANAG 4193, and of similar performance to current interrogators and capable of operating in all existing IFF/SSR modes (1, 2, 3/A, C, 4) in addition to Mode S. A cost effective solution that retains the ship's current IFF/SSR capability through substitution of the existing IFF Interrogators, without major changes to the host platform systems, is required; for example, the replacement IFF Interrogator will be required to fit within the weight and space constraints of the current interrogator, will use existing antenna systems and power supplies and will ideally interface with the existing ADAWS command system. Key physical and functional characteristics of the RT1016 (TPX-54) IFF Interrogator are: Range greater than 300 miles. Antenna rotation 7.5 rpm or 30 rpm depending on primary radar. Cabinet Assembly Height 1250mm, Width 558mm, Depth 545mm. Mass 170Kg. The current RT1016 interrogators are fully integrated with the ship's command system for control and display. Major modification of the ship's command system to accommodate a replacement interrogator is not planned. Therefore, a replacement interrogator that will interface with the un-modified ADAWS command system is sought. If IFF interrogators with similar interfaces to the current equipment, and which therefore provide a simple path for integration with the ships' command system, are not available, dedicated control and display facilities to enable stand alone operation will be considered. The outline procurement programme is: Receive expressions of interest and issue detailed Statement of Work with Pre Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) October 2008; Following analysis of PQQ responses issue Invitation To Tender (ITT) to appropriate contractors in December 2008; Conduct evaluation trials of candidate equipments against the Type 42 Shore Integration Facility (SIF) located at the Land Based Test Site (LBTS) at Portsdown Technology Park between December 2008 and April 2009. Tender Submission following completion of evaluation trials. Down select equipment, Assurance & Approvals activities leading to Main Gate in June 2009. Contract Award in July 2009. Integration, performance and acceptance testing at the Type 42 SIF, followed by installation, Set to Work and harbour/sea trials of all ships ideally by CAA deadline of 31 December 2011. More detailed information will be issued with any subsequent Invitation to Tender. Tenderers will be required to provide their Interrogator interface information and sample equipment for evaluation and trials at the LBTS, scheduled to commence in December 2008, in advance of formal tender submissions. It is expected that the core interrogator equipment will be at production standard, but it is recognised that ancillary equipment, such as interface, control and display equipment is likely to be pre-production standard. ."
