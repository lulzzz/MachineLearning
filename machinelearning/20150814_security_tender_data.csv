The procurement for an ISP to help establish and support our employee - led mutual is highly innovative, and is being supported by the Cabinet Office as a national pilot. It is envisaged that the ISP will provide support and assistance for the creation and operation of the employee - led mutual, which is currently anticipated will be structured as a joint venture company with the share holding shared between the ISP and the employees (held on the employees’ behalf in an employee benefit trust). The Contracting Authority will have a contractual arrangement with the employee- led mutual for the employee - led mutual to provide some of the services, supplies and works listed below (and further defined in the initial descriptive document) for a period of not less than four years. The specific shareholding to be held by the ISP will be subject to the dialogue undertaken as part of this process, although under a joint venture structure, the maximum holding for any independent sector partner will be capped to balance ownership in favour of employee ownership. The Contracting Authority is working closely with the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster City Council, and it is intended that staff from all three boroughs will be transferred into the Mutual Joint Venture company under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. The Contracting Authority is procuring on behalf of all education bodies within the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham, the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster City Council for a independent partner to set up the employee - led mutual. The client side may reside with the Contracting Authority who will act on its behalf and that of the Participating Authorities. However, following the award of the Contract, the client - side arrangement may be transferred from the Contracting Authority to one of the other Participating Authorities. The primary purpose of creating the employee- led mutual is specifically to undertake the following services, supplies or works to “relevant educational establishments” defined below within the London boroughs of Hammersmith & Fulham, Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster commissioned either by the Contracting Authority or the governing bodies of these establishments. The relevant educational establishments collectively mean: — educational facilities (which will include primary and secondary schools and may include tertiary education), — other children's facilities (including but not limited to after school club facilities, youth clubs etc), — accommodation for adult education and Special Educational Needs (SEN) education, — community facilities whether co-located with any of the above facilities or freestanding (including but not limited to halls, drop-in centres, crèches, sheltered workshops etc). As a commercial organisation the employee led mutual will also offer its services to non-maintained schools,such as Academies and Free schools. The services, supplies and works to the relevant educational facilities will include either direct provision by the employee led mutual or the sub-contracting to other providers. The scope of the services, supplies and works to the relevant educational facilities may include: — (i) information communication and technology (\""ICT\"") services, — (ii) ICT supplies, — (iii) architectural services, — (iv) engineering services, — (v) construction related works, supplies and services (including lifecycle planned maintenance and reactive maintenance), — (vi) security services, — (vii) building services, — (viii) hard facilities management services (e.g. building fabric and mechanical installations), — (ix) soft facilities management services (e.g. catering, cleaning, security, and health & safety), — (x) educational support services, and — (xi) educational strategy services, — (xii) consultancy services (procurement projects e.g. free school meals).""}"

The process seeks to establish a framework agreement for the supply of ICT services and resources to support Home Groups existing ICT department in the delivery of cost effective and fit for purpose technology based solutions. Home has an existing ICT team which is spread over a number of disciplines and is looking to have arrangements in place to allow extra technical resources to be brought on line as workload dictates. Home is especially interested in respondents with proven approaches to the delivery of ICT services and solutions that are in line with Home’s current technology platform and future requirements (described in detail below). Particular consideration will be given to the quality and expertise of resources that would be available to Home. Summary of Technical Environment. Home Group Limited has in excess of 3200 desktop and laptops connected to a central data suite which houses approximately 200 servers/virtual servers. All desktop and laptops are built to a standard image, currently utilising Windows XP, SP3. This environment has Microsoft Outlook and Office deployed directly to the desktop with other line of business apps accessed through Citrix and increasingly through Internet Explorer. VMware is utilised for server virtualisation. The server farm is being upgraded from Windows 2003 to Windows 2008 SP2 (within the next 12 months. A number of database platforms are in use within the organisation with SQL Server predominate. Our IIE (Internet, Intranet, and Extranet) services are run internally from the organisation utilising the Share point environment. Microsoft BizTalk is becoming an increasingly important technology for multi-system communication and to allow us to engage effectively with our suppliers. Current focus for the department is the creation of a dedicated Contact Centre, part of which will be the implementation of the Lagan CRM solution with relevant integration into our core systems, in particular Capita’s Open Housing Management System and Cedar Open Financials. Home has approximately 400 BT WAN connected sites 100 Telewest/BT connected sites and a handful of Site-to-Site VPN'S. This is currently under review. Cisco comms equipment provides all connectivity within the infrastructure. Core VoIP technology is Avaya. Proposed Contract. The deliverable from this process will be a competitive framework agreement that will enable Home Group to competitively select IS technical or project resource from: — mini-tender (across all or a selection) or, — call off (from a fixed price list submitted at tender stage) specific. Proposed Contract Term: We envisage letting a contract of a maximum of 4 years’ duration (2 years plus potential 2 year extension) to suppliers. Contracts must include an optional 12 month break-clause that can be activated by Home Group should the supplier not achieve the agreed deliverables, performance or service level. High level specification. Home Group’s ICT department comprises of 60+ staff covering a wide range of ICT functions including: — Networking and Security, — Telecommunications, — Infrastructure Architecture and Maintenance, — Data Centre Management and Disaster Recovery, — Business Software and Applications Development and Support, — Onsite Technical Engineers, — Front Line Service Desk, — IS Operations (ITIL Processes; IT procurement and other internal and external facing services), — Project Management. The ICT team have to respond to a fast paced, changing business environment, provide exceptional levels of service to their colleagues, ensure that they deliver solutions following industry standard best practice and ensure that solutions are delivered in a controlled manner to the business. We expect our partners and individuals working under the framework agreement to fit into and work closely in conjunction with the technical teams, becoming valuable members of the team. Due to the number of projects undertaken at Home Group now and for the next 2-4 years, a framework agreement is required to enable Home Group to supplement their existing staff base with specialist skills as and when required, as well as supplementing their existing staff base with additional people when the demand for ICT resource is high.""}"

The Cabinet Office, on behalf of HM Government (HMG) is seeking to appoint a PSP to establish, and be majority shareholder in, a DMI that is capable of delivering a suite of debt management services to a range of UK government departments and other UK Contracting Authorities. The DMI will offer a range of existing and new services that provide improved debt management and increased net yield through better debt analytics, debt collection, debt enforcement, litigation and fraud and error services and possibly debt sales. It is expected that the PSP, through the DMI, will have/provide: 1. A proven ability to deliver reliable, high quality and innovative retail debt management services at scale in the UK; or an equivalent proven scale retail debt services delivery capability elsewhere, together with comprehensive and credible evidence of sufficient practical understanding of the UK debt market and experience of successfully adapting retail debt operations to demonstrate the ability to succeed in the UK; 2. A proven ability to manage a supply chain in the debt services arena; 3. A proven ability to adapt services to comply with relevant local legislative, regulatory requirements and good practice; 4. Experience of working successfully in joint ventures or partnerships with the public or private sector; 5. Initial funding to establish the DMI company; and 6. The ability to grow a sustainable and profitable business. The Departments that are collaborating with the Cabinet Office as ‘Initial Customers' of the DMI are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP), the Student Loans Company (SLC), the Legal Aid Agency (LAA), the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the Home Office (HO), however, the Cabinet Office envisages the DMI will offer cost effective debt management services to all its customers including other UK Contracting Authorities. Potential Bidders should note that the composition of Initial Customers could be subject to change during the procurement process. HMG will retain a significant minority equity stake in the DMI with corresponding Board representation including an influence in its future strategy and growth. HMG will retain responsibility for UK debt-related policy and legislation. It is expected that the DMI will be a non-public corporate entity with a Board and Management team appointed by its owners. Its growth and profitability will be directly linked to its ability to improve debt management and increase net yield for HMG and other customers. The successful bidder for the role of PSP will, through the procedure contemplated by this Notice, acquire and hold equity share capital in the DMI through a Shareholders' Agreement, Articles of Association, Subscription Agreement and other relevant documents. The Cabinet Office recognises that, in order to provide the services required and achieve the stated objectives, the PSP may use sub-contractors to provide some of the services. We also welcome consortia bids. In all cases, we expect to contract with a single entity and expect a simple, transparent and credible Governance structure between parties. It is expected that the DMI will provide the sole route to market for debt management for the Initial Customers. The debt management services to be provided by the DMI are a comprehensive and integrated suite of debt management services including, but not limited to: — Analytics (for example but not limited to Predictive Modelling, Collection Optimisation, Purchase and use of Business/Market Intelligence, Decision Analytics, Case Management); — Collection (for example but not limited to Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management, Management of third party suppliers of these services); — Enforcement and Litigation (Debt Collection, Case Management, Payments and Accounting, Debtor Correspondence, Data Management); — Fraud and error services; — Debt Sales; and — Strategic and tactical advice on improving debt yields. The DMI services should be flexible, allowing customers of the DMI a choice to procure either a single service or any number of services across the whole range of offerings in order to satisfy individual circumstances, timetables and specific requirements. DMI services should be delivered in the context of the spirit of treating debtors fairly – in particular those in hardship. The Cabinet Office will award to the PSP a Framework Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Notice. Call Off Contracts will then be entered into between the DMI and the Initial Customers. Details of the volumes of debt from Initial Customers can be found in the IM which will be made available as part of the PQQ process. In addition to the Initial Customers referred to above, it is intended that the Framework Agreement will allow the DMI to provide the services specified above to other public sector bodies including but not limited to all UK Government Departments and their Arm's Length Bodies and Agencies; Non Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs); NHS bodies, Local Authorities and devolved administrations of Scotland and Northern Ireland (together the 'Participating Bodies').

The Council recognises the importance of the \""place making\"" agenda through designing quality places and supporting sustainable communities. The Council will require the successful bidder to take forward the masterplan and outline planning permission and to deliver a significant first phase of approximately 23 hectares to include circa 950 low/zero carbon new homes with 30 % affordable housing, a new commercial village centre with a primary school, as the first phase of co-located community social infrastructure, up to 5 hectares of employment land, significant open space provision and early highways and public transportation improvements. Social, economic and environmental regeneration is important to the Council. Leicester City Council schemes propose to promote a stronger economy better able to meet the needs of the community and to develop measures to promote social inclusion.

As set out in the PIN and accompanying Prospectus for the Future IT Sourcing Programme (FITS) the MoJ's current major ICT contracts were negotiated prior to the creation of the MoJ. As a result, the contracts are broadly aligned to business units within the Authority (e.g. NOMS, HMCTS, Headquarters) rather than supporting economic, standard and integrated services across the Authority. These legacy contracts are due to expire in the next few years. The FITS Programme has been established to implement a Service Tower operating model for the delivery of ICT Services across the MoJ and to procure replacement contracts that align with and support this model. This Contract Notice covers the procurement of Protective Monitoring (PM) services. MoJ does not propose to place any specific constraints on the number or combination of contracts for which any supplier may bid in this and later competitions. However, in order to minimise any conflict of interest, the successful bidder for PM services will be asked to demonstrate appropriate ethical walls are in place between the parts of its organisation responsible for the delivery of PM services and those parts that may be responsible for the delivery of services in other Service Towers. Providers who are considering bidding for other Towers and who might be selected for the PM tower should consider the implications this will have for them. Providers should also take note that the FITS programme intends to use pan-government frameworks for some of the FITS Lots e.g. PSN for Networks, and will need to consider the impact of bidding against MoJ's requirements within these frameworks if they are also bidding for other Lots in the FITS Programme. Suppliers who are considering bidding for EUC and any other service tower should consider the implications this will have for them, the MoJ and other Service Tower Providers. The MoJ is seeking to procure a fully managed protective monitoring capability from a single provider. Whilst the project will not mandate exactly how this capability should be delivered, it is anticipated that it will involve the deployment of equipment and software into other Tower environments, connectivity with these environments, and process interaction with the other Tower providers as well as with MoJ. Protective Monitoring will be deployed to areas of MoJ's ICT estate where it can achieve the most value.

As set out in the PIN and accompanying Prospectus for the Future IT Sourcing Programme (FITS) the MoJ's current major ICT contracts were negotiated prior to the creation of the MoJ. As a result, the contracts are broadly aligned to business units within the Authority (e.g. NOMS, HMCTS, Headquarters) rather than supporting economic, standard and integrated services across the Authority. These legacy contracts are due to expire in the next few years. The FITS Programme has been established to implement a Service Tower operating model for the delivery of ICT Services across the MoJ and to procure replacement contracts that align with and support this model. This Contract Notice covers the procurement of Protective Monitoring (PM) services. MoJ does not propose to place any specific constraints on the number or combination of contracts for which any supplier may bid in this and later competitions. However, in order to minimise any conflict of interest, the successful bidder for PM services will be asked to demonstrate appropriate ethical walls are in place between the parts of its organisation responsible for the delivery of PM services and those parts that may be responsible for the delivery of services in other Service Towers. Providers who are considering bidding for other Towers and who might be selected for the PM tower should consider the implications this will have for them. Providers should also take note that the FITS programme intends to use pan-government frameworks for some of the FITS Lots e.g. PSN for Networks, and will need to consider the impact of bidding against MoJ's requirements within these frameworks if they are also bidding for other Lots in the FITS Programme. Suppliers who are considering bidding for EUC and any other service tower should consider the implications this will have for them, the MoJ and other Service Tower Providers. The MoJ is seeking to procure a fully managed protective monitoring capability from a single provider. Whilst the project will not mandate exactly how this capability should be delivered, it is anticipated that it will involve the deployment of equipment and software into other Tower environments, connectivity with these environments, and process interaction with the other Tower providers as well as with MoJ. Protective Monitoring will be deployed to areas of MoJ's ICT estate where it can achieve the most value.

EM services are currently used to facilitate the curfew of a subject given either a community order, court bail order or released on licence (collectively referred to as ‘Orders’). Bidders that initially respond to this notice and successfully pre-qualify will be pre-qualified to participate in the competition for the specified lots. From those bidders who meet the Authority's minimum pre-qualification criteria (pre-qualified bidders), a short-list of bidders will be selected for the next stage of the competition (the invitation to negotiate) – see further details below relating to the tendering and award restrictions and lot selection. The Authority shall use the competition to enable delivery of specific departmental strategic initiatives including those recently identified in the Authority’s Green Paper (“Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of Offenders”) and the competition strategy for offender services, particularly regarding the tracking of subjects. The scope of EM services will be divided into four elements (lots) as follows. I. Monitoring service including the processing centre, related hardware and software, and field operatives; II. Monitoring and mapping software applications; III. Monitoring hardware (anklets etc.) and firmware and software; IV. Network (Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)). The Authority reserves the right at any time to move certain functions between the lots. The successful monitoring service provider for lot (I) will be the service and system integrator. This means that the successful monitoring service provider will be given the power of agency to act on behalf of the Authority in appropriate areas to ensure that interface risks are properly managed with the monitoring service provider acting in some respects in the manner of a prime contractor with the service providers for lots (II), (III) and (IV) in the role of sub-contractors. For the avoidance of doubt, contracts for all lots will be awarded directly by the Authority, who will be solely responsible for bidder selection. Preferred bidders will be designated for all of the lots prior to award of contracts. Negotiations will then be concluded with all preferred bidders to establish a back-to-back service and system integration agreement, binding on all parties that will contain the appropriate commercial provisions supporting an end to end service to the Authority. The Authority is proceeding under the negotiated procedure on the grounds set out in Regulations 13(b) and 13(c) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006. Due to the complexity and technical nature of the services to be procured, it is not possible to fully specify in advance any preferred solutions and the Authority wishes to engage with bidders in order to identify what solutions are available on the market, including any potential innovations which different bidders may be able to offer. In particular it is also not possible to specify in advance how the lots will be integrated or how each potential provider will work with each other to deliver the services. The negotiated procedure will allow the Authority to identify operational risks across the service, which it is yet not possible to predict, and consider their management with bidders. The cost impact of risk acceptance and/or transfer will need to be discussed and agreed with bidders during the competition as the total operating model is developed and a system integration agreement is established. The Authority will need to be able to engage in meaningful and detailed discussions with preferred bidders regarding different service models in order to identify a final solution that is acceptable, robustly operable and capable of being priced. Taking into account the different specialisms required and the possible number of different proposals by bidders, it has not been possible to set an estimated overall price at the start of the procurement process other than to give an estimated range of values for the purposes of this notice. It is the Authority’s intention to deliver maximum alignment between the delivery of the Electronic monitoring service, the Ministry of Justice Future IT Strategy (FITS) and the Government’s ICT strategy. Specifically, the successful network service provider for lot (IV) must adhere to the Government Public Services Network (PSN) standards which will be updated from time to time during the course of the competition and term of the contract. Bidders shall make express reference to the current technical domain description - version 2.0 which may also be updated from time to time during the course of the competition and term of the contract.

In the event that any part of the solution, for any of the lots, is based upon standard components which are available through Government framework agreements, the Authority reserves the right to either directly procure, or require the successful supplier to procure such items under the terms of the Government framework agreement.

All bidders may express an interest in a maximum of 3 lots. Bidders will be precluded from expressing an interest in, and bidding for, both lot (I) and lot (III) together (and this preclusion shall also apply to (a) the subsidiary and holding companies of the bidder and any other subsidiaries of the holding companies (as defined by s1159 Companies Act 2006) and to (b) any consortium members and significant subcontractors as defined in the RFI). Subject to the outcome of the Government PSN competition, one bidder may be successful in being awarded contracts for lots (I), (II), and (IV) or alternatively (II), (III) and (IV)– or may be successful in relation to individual lots within those groupings. The Authority will limit the number of bidders to be invited to negotiate per lot to a maximum of 4 in the case of lots (I), (III) and (IV).

The Authority is proceeding under the negotiated procedure on the grounds set out in Regulations 13(b) and 13(c) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006. Due to the complexity and technical nature of the services to be procured, it is not possible to fully specify in advance any preferred solutions and the Authority wishes to engage with bidders in order to identify what solutions are available on the market, including any potential innovations which different bidders may be able to offer. In particular it is also not possible to specify in advance how the lots will be integrated or how each potential provider will work with each other to deliver the services. The negotiated procedure will allow the Authority to identify operational risks across the service, which it is yet not possible to predict, and consider their management with bidders. The cost impact of risk acceptance and/or transfer will need to be discussed and agreed with bidders during the competition as the total operating model is developed and a system integration agreement is established. The Authority will need to be able to engage in meaningful and detailed discussions with preferred bidders regarding different service models in order to identify a final solution that is acceptable, robustly operable and capable of being priced. Taking into account the different specialisms required and the possible number of different proposals by bidders, it has not been possible to set an estimated overall price at the start of the procurement process other than to give an estimated range of values for the purposes of this notice. It is the Authority’s intention to deliver maximum alignment between the delivery of the Electronic monitoring service, the Ministry of Justice Future IT Strategy (FITS) and the Government’s ICT strategy. Specifically, the successful network service provider for lot (IV) must adhere to the Government Public Services Network (PSN) standards which will be updated from time to time during the course of the competition and term of the contract. Bidders shall make express reference to the current technical domain description - version 2.0 which may also be updated from time to time during the course of the competition and term of the contract. Further information about PSN can be obtained at http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/public-services-network. It is the intention of the Authority to review the outcome of the Government's PSN Connectivity and services framework competitions, currently scheduled for award in Spring 2012. The Authority reserves the right to not to award any contract under lot (IV) and instead obtain Network services via the future PSN connectivity and / or services framework agreements [or under other agreements] in line with the Authority's FITS network tower/mobiles procurement approach. In the event that any part of the solution, for any of the lots, is based upon standard components which are available through Government framework agreements, the Authority reserves the right to either directly procure, or require the successful supplier to procure such items under the terms of the Government framework agreement. Tendering and award restrictions. As part of the pre-qualification and RFI process bidders are required to identify those lots they wish to bid for. All bidders may express an interest in a maximum of 3 lots. Bidders will be precluded from expressing an interest in, and bidding for, both lot (I) and lot (III) together (and this preclusion shall also apply to (a) the subsidiary and holding companies of the bidder and any other subsidiaries of the holding companies (as defined by s1159 Companies Act 2006) and to (b) any consortium members and significant subcontractors as defined in the RFI). Subject to the outcome of the Government PSN competition, one bidder may be successful in being awarded contracts for lots (I), (II), and (IV) or alternatively (II), (III) and (IV)– or may be successful in relation to individual lots within those groupings. The Authority will limit the number of bidders to be invited to negotiate per lot to a maximum of 4 in the case of lots (I), (III) and (IV). Where more than 4 bidders meet the Authority's minimum pre-qualification criteria for any of lots (I), (III) or (IV), the Authority will short-list the 4 highest ranking bidders for the relevant lot as assessed against the Authority's pre-qualification criteria. The Authority will limit the number of bidders to be invited to negotiate for lot (II) to a maximum of 7. Where more than 7 bidders meet the Authority's minimum pre-qualification criteria for lot (II), the Authority will short-list the 7 highest ranking bidders as assessed against the Authority's pre-qualification criteria provided that it shall only short-list the 6th and the 7th highest if its respective score is within 5 % of the score of the 5th highest ranking bidder for lot (II). The contract for lot (I) shall be for a period of six years. Contracts for lots (II), (III) and (IV) shall be for a period of three years. There will be options to extend the contracts in all of the lots as described in more detail in the information about lots section. The Authority may from time to time seek additional information or updates from those bidders that have pre-qualified to update, verify and confirm the details that they have provided. Further details are provided in the \""Information about Lots\"" section and in the Authority's Request for Information (RFI). Details of how to respond to this notice and obtain the RFI are set out in Section VI.3. Greater detail of the interfaces between all lots and the Authority’s requirements will be provided in the invitation to negotiate (ITN) documentation.""}"

430184-2014,2014,"{""Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (the ‘Trust’) is interested in seeking a private sector partner (‘Partner’) to provide an intelligent infrastructure strategy function that will support the Trust's clinical strategy to enable service change, improve quality of care for patients and drive efficiency in the Trust's operations including potentially through (but not limited to): estates rationalisation; capital programme planning; raising finance and investment; strategic service transformation planning; and also the procurement and project/contract management of a range of services including construction and FM services. It is expected that these services will be provided to the Trust through the establishment of a joint venture body (JV) between the Trust and the Partner. The Trust predominantly provides services from Queen's Hospital in Burton, Sir Robert Peel Community Hospital in Tamworth and Samuel Johnson Community Hospital in Lichfield. Both of the sites in Lichfield and Tamworth provide a range of services including inpatient and outpatient services, and Minor Injuries Units. Maternity services are provided at Queen's Hospital and Samuel Johnson Community Hospital. The Trust offers a total of just over 540 beds as well as a wide range of general hospital services and a purpose built Treatment Centre. The Trust intends to redevelop/dispose of an adjacent site (Outwoods site). The Partner will provide the Priority Services (more particularly described below) through the JV upon appointment of the successful partner or shortly thereafter. Responsibility for procuring, co-ordinating and managing the provision of Secondary Services (more particularly described below) through the JV may be transferred to the Partner during the term of the partnership. The Partner will be expected to deliver Priority Services consisting of Strategic Estates Services. This includes the provision of consultancy support services to provide estate strategy advice (with a focus on achieving efficiencies), preparation of an estates strategy that will support the Trust's clinical strategy and drive efficiency in the Trust's operations and the preparation, review and updating of a partnership business plan to cover the proposed need, phasing of service transformation at the Trust's estate and the timing of the delivery of any proposed new projects or refurbishment projects to deliver capital requirements (‘New Projects’). The Partner is also expected to provide access to, arrange and deliver private sector capital where required to finance New Projects. New Projects may involve (but are not limited to) capital works; refurbishment works; disposal and/or acquisition of land; facilities to support NHS services, related health and social care services as well as commercial developments. Initial New Projects may potentially include: — The transformation of services through Community Hospitals and accommodation for the elderly to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of the estate and services. —  The redevelopment/disposal of the Outwoods site in Burton and redistribution of the vacated services to the Queen's Hospital site. —  A car parking solution that will complement the Trust's commitment to a green transport plan and improve patient/public experience. —  Commercial opportunities for the benefit of the Trust and patients, including catering/a new front entrance/patient contact and customer service opportunities. To ensure value for money is achieved at the time when projects are commenced and services required, (and in observing EU procurement principles on behalf of the Trust) it is expected that the JV, via a secondary procurement, will competitively tender the supply chain for each New Project or Secondary Service required. The Partner (through the JV) will therefore provide an integrator role in procuring and coordinating these third-party providers to deliver schemes and services for the benefit of the Trust. This integrator role includes the provision of operational project management services in procuring, co-ordinating and managing external contractors engaged to deliver any proposed and approved New Projects to deliver capital requirements for works, fabrication or traditional estate project procurements and also any external contractors required to deliver Secondary Services approved by the Trust. The Partner's integrator role may also include providing operational procurement consultancy services in co-ordinating, managing and conducting procurements observing EU procurement principles to appoint a supply-chain to the JV to deliver those services; and The Partner may be required to plan, procure, co-ordinate and manage Secondary Services which may include: (1) Facility Support Services —  which may include Facilities Management (including Estates Helpdesk and Energy Management (and incidental energy generation)); Catering; Cleaning; Laundry; Parking and Traffic Management; Security (Infrastructure); Portering; Pest Control; Grounds and Gardens Maintenance; and Clinical and General Waste; and (2) Customer Satisfaction Services —  which may include but not be limited to Reception Services, Customer Satisfaction Services, Patient Contact Centre Services; and (3) Corporate Back Office Services. The opportunity is to provide a strategic, commercial, development, investment, procurement, project management and contract management role in delivering capital projects and transforming services to support the Trust's clinical strategy but the scope does not include the provision of delivering the detailed design and construction aspects of the New Projects or the provision of Secondary Services themselves. The Trust is interested in the JV seeking other commercial and income generation opportunities in the public and private sector market over the long-term and proposing innovative proposals in support of the Trust's clinical strategy that will maximise income or allow the Trust to reduce costs. The JV partnership with the successful Partner will be for a period of 10 years with an option to extend the contract for a further 5 years. Further details of the opportunity are provided in the Memorandum of Information accompanying the pre-qualification questionnaire (see section VI.3 (Additional Information) for details of how to obtain these).""}"

For more information, visit www.ofcom.org.uk Ofcom plans to procure a selected number of services under a total facilities management contract across its estate of seven buildings to succeed those provided under the terms of Ofcom's current facilities management contracted arrangements. The service delivery at all the sites will become the responsibility of the supplier that is successful in the new procurement and is awarded the new total facilities management contract. We intend the scope of the contract to include the following: Manager — Currently a full time manager is based at RSH. With the increase in service provision across all locations a pro-active approach to the day to day and strategic management of the contract is required to ensure client satisfaction. The manager would be expected to have a background skill set in both hard and soft services. Help-desk — The current help-desk consists of a full time employee based on site at RSH having a soft services background. Going forward it is envisaged that the appointed supplier will review the Help-desk requirements and provide a service having a clear understanding of any current issues and able to respond to meet those during core hours. At all other times the Help-desk needs to be aware of issues and provide a help-desk function aligned to the SLAs and KPIs. Maintenance — The Ofcom maintainable building services assets at Riverside House are considered ‘standard'. The planned and reactive maintenance service delivery has to date required delivery by on site technicians with the appropriate skills and capabilities, specifically an electrical qualification to the current edition. Compliance — This service delivery stream will encompass the organisation and reporting of: directly delivered, landlord and managing agent activity to pragmatically monitor all Ofcom locations for legislative compliance. The supplier will be required to identify non legislative compliance and non-conformance to agreed best practise and pro-actively manage the programme to correct these issues pragmatically. Energy management — The appointed supplier will have significant experience in this field and will utilise dedicated in-house and specialist resource to pro-actively promote energy management through focussed initiatives. These supplier led initiatives will consider: remove, reduce, recycle, and reuse improving energy management. From a supply perspective the appointed supplier will utilise expertise to provide utility and energy market advice. The supplier will also manage tenders for electricity and gas to provide best value and innovation over the contract duration and beyond. Fire Systems — As well as being responsible for the maintenance of detection and fire-fighting systems in accordance with current fire regulations and standards. The supplier will also ensure the fire-fighting systems are maintained in accordance with the manufacturers warranty and required accreditations. The supplier will be pro-active in providing advice on current best practise. Fabric — The appointed supplier will be responsible for planned, cyclical and reactive maintenance activities including: gutter clearance, re-glazing and repairs to doors as agreed with Ofcom. Typically there will be an expectation on the supplier to utilise technologies such as thermography to identify and address issues. Lifts — The appointed supplier will be responsible for optimising the operation and maintenance of the vertical transportation (Lifts) taking account of legislations, usage and energy. Security — The appointed supplier will actively work with Ofcom in maintaining the various systems such as Intruder alarms and access control systems. The supplier shall provide a manned guarding service at Riverside House and the supplier will proactively contribute to current security thinking to protect the welfare of Ofcom personnel. Cleaning — The appointed supplier will be responsible for delivering effective and performance monitored cleaning services where identified.

The security managed service will provide the standard device management and security monitoring and alerting activities that provide the day to day tactical levels of security protection.

The security managed service is required to augment the in-house NOC/SOC with monitoring support, threat analysis and assessment. e.g. firewall management, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). It is envisaged that the managed service will be delivered by one framework partner and the transformation requirements will be delivered by two framework partners (of which one will include the managed service framework partner).

This framework will be let by the contracting authority and can be utilised by NHS Trusts, NHS Foundation Trusts (including PFI healthcare buildings and facilities), NHS Collaborative Procurement Organisations, Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS England and NHS Property Services Ltd. The framework duration will be 2 years with the option to extend by up to 24 months, using two twelve month blocks (2 x 12 months). This framework will enable participating organisations to conduct further (mini) competitions with selected service providers as and when their organisation's requirement arises. The framework will be divided into Lots to cover specific areas of Maintenance Services. The lots have been separated into two categories: 1. Maintenance Service Lots. 2. Geographic Regions. This categorisation will allow suppliers the flexibility to tender for specific maintenance services in selected areas of geographic coverage. 1. Maintenance Service Lots. The Maintenance Services are given in the Lots listed below. Providers will submit tenders based on their experience and capabilities in the individual Lots, and on the regions to be covered. It is envisaged that providers will submit their tenders in the following combinations: A Tender for only one Maintenance Service Lot (a single Lot within Lots 1 through to 14), A Tender for multiple Maintenance Service Lots (a combination within Lots 1 through to 14), A Tender for all the Maintenance Service options (Lots 1 through to 14). Providers are at liberty to tender for any or all of the Lots in each region. During their decision-making process, providers should consider the following points: — Their expertise in carrying out any / all of the listed Maintenance Service Lots, — The geographic areas they can cover, — As explained in this Notice (and the Memorandum of Information), further (mini) competitions may be carried out at the regional level, after the contract award. These further (mini) competitions are dependant on the specific requirements of the Trusts and other framework users within the regions, and therefore may be for any number of the Lots, — For clarification please note that providers can only be selected for any further (mini) competitions based on the specific lots that they have tendered for and consequently been awarded. For example, a provider tendering for Lot 1 only will not be eligible to participate in any further (mini) competitions for Lots 2 through to 14. The maintenance service lots to be tendered for are: Lot 1 — Fully Managed Building and Engineering Maintenance Service. Lot 2 — Cooling and Refrigeration — Chillers, Condensers, Split A/C's. Lot 3 — Air Handling Units, Filters, Ventilation and Extraction. Lot 4 — Lifts, Escalators and Conveyance Systems. Lot 5 — Patient Hoists.

Lot 9 — Building Management Systems and Automatic Control Systems. Lot 10 — Security, Access Control, Intruder and CCTV systems. Lot 11 — UPS and Generators. Lot 12 v Portable Appliance Testing (PAT), Fixed Wire Testing. Lot 13 — Automatic Doors. Lot 14 — Medical gas pipeline and equipment maintenance. For clarification please note that the services in Lots 1 – 14 include the planned preventative maintenance, fully comprehensive maintenance and the reactive and repair maintenance aspects of these services. In tendering for Lot 1 — Fully Managed Building Engineering Maintenance Service; providers will need to ensure that they can provide all of the services covered by Lots 2-14 either directly or through the engagement of sub-contractors. 2. Geographic Regions The scope of this framework is the NHS Trusts across NHS England. The areas and Trusts covered by NHS England, has been used to define the Geographic Lots: — London (Region A), — North England (Region B), — Midlands and East of England (Region C), — South of England (Region D).

The Ministry of Defence has a requirement for a Service Provider to deliver a range of services, predominantly human, to contribute to the creation of realistic training environments for military forces preparing them through Individual phased training and collectively for deployed operations worldwide. The training support provided will integrate with existing Individual and collective training structures to ensure that trainees are sufficiently trained and experienced in military Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), Field craft and to operate in the demanding and complex contemporary and future environments encountered on operations. These training support services will be provided initially to the MOD and potentially other government departments within the UK and Worldwide. Key services delivered will include, but not necessarily be limited to, human, Demonstration Forces (DEMFOR), Opposing Forces (OPFOR), state and non-state actors plus their networks; the indigenous population through accurate replication of culture, language, social structures and population dynamics, an accurate replication of the indigenous security forces, a representation of battlefield casualties (CASSIM) to support immediate medical response training; and support to conceptual training that is designed to significantly increase the depth of UK forces' cultural understanding of the environment in which they will operate and physical representation of that required environment (including the provision of replica urban props and soft infrastructure). Additional training support tasks that enhance realism by design and effect which are unavailable from internal resources, which contribute directly to successful training delivery are included within the scope of this advert, such as but not limited to scenario writing, pyrotechnic effects, labourers and limited security roles. Training is currently delivered throughout the year at military training establishments and training areas, primarily within the UK and Europe, but potentially at other locations. Demand is variable and is set annually and the service provided will need to be responsive to increases/decreases in demand. Initially in the order of 57 000 Man Training Days (MTDs) spread over the year with the current requirement highlighting peaks of demand that involve upwards of 400 role players over a period of approximately 7-10 consecutive days, six or seven times per year. Numbers of role players per event will vary from one person for one day to the peaks described above. There are circa 300 events spread throughout the year, events can run concurrently but major events rarely coincide. There is a requirement to support surge and short notice training activities that demand flexibility and agility in constructing bespoke environments. The Service Provider will need to be intelligent, responsive and adaptive in its delivery through a holistic management mechanism that works closely with the customer to deliver realistic training support responsive to an ever changing and challenging operational environment. Contractor performance will be measured against Training Objectives (TO). Training Objectives are set by the Authority to assess a Training Audience performance against those objectives required to meet military tasks. The provider should reach an objective standard of performance to contribute actively to the success of the training mission.""}"

Between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. there are approximately 6 to 10 people working in the Communications Centre (a separate building located on the Headquarters site) at any one time. Saturday and Sunday there are approximately 6 to 12 people working in the Communication Centre at any one time. The Communications Centre is a shared facility with both Fire and Ambulance Service. Fire personnel has a total of 13 officers working 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. – 24/7 every day of the week. Seven officers working night duty 6 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. Up to 6 officers attend a training day where lunch is provided and the training can last up to 4 weeks. Ambulance personnel have up to 55 officers on a day time shift and 13 officers working night duty – 24/7 every day of the week.

All income from such sales will be retained by the Contractor. Residential personnel: Normal weekly requirement for each residential student will entail 4 breakfasts, 5 lunches and 4 evening meals. There is no requirement for breakfast Monday mornings or an evening meal Friday. Estimated numbers will normally be available up to one week in advance. On occasions students are accommodated in local hotels, therefore no breakfast requirements would be needed, but lunch and evening meals would need to be provided. Due to times of austerity there are no set intakes of students or set student numbers for training courses held. Training is now arranged ‘on demand’. Based on projected recruitment needs, it is proposed there will be an intake of 18 officers in 2012/13, and 36 officers in 2013/14. Please note that these figures are not definitive and may be subject to change. Other Functions: Emergency Services. The Contractor shall be prepared, upon short notice, to supply refreshments and/or meals for large numbers of operational officers, in the event of such a requirement. This may occur within normal catering hours in which event the agreed prices shall apply. At other periods, including weekends, or when the service is to be provided other than at Force Headquarters, this also includes the SCC when potentially a call out of staff could result at any time during the night. Charges will be between the Contractor and the authorised officer but pricing proposals will be transparent and based on actual costs for food and labour required. The Contractor will be responsible for providing catering services in the event of a Major Incident i.e. activation of SCC and all meals to be provided for staff will be catered from the Force HQ – Powys Dinner/Pembrokeshire Café (there will be a requirement to transport meals to either SCC or Force Communications Centre both buildings are on site).

Specific information regarding lot 5 - domestic disabled adaptations works: Housing Resources and Assisted Living (HRAL) are a division of the Council responsible for making funding available towards the installation of adaptations (disabled facilities) to cross tenure properties and repairs to privately owned properties where the applicant is able to prove to the Council that they meet the prevailing criteria. The Council has a statutory duty to determine applications for grant assistance to provide such adaptations or repairs in accordance with the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and the Regulatory Reform Order 2002. The works primarily involve the adaptation or repairs of domestic properties as a result of the approval of a Disabled Facilities Grant, Repairs Grant or any Discretionary Grant awarded to the applicant. To support this area HRAL operate a \""grant agency service\"" that provides a professional, technical and administrative service to the clients (service users). Put simply, the Council provides a service whereby the service users can appoint the Council to administer the grant on the service user’s behalf whilst working closely with the Community Occupational Therapy Service to ensure that the service users' needs are fully met.""}"

The Contracting Authority is seeking to procure on behalf of itself and the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea and the City of Westminster (both referred to as “the participating authorities”) an innovative private sector partner to invest in, develop and provide a range of total facilities management services through a strategic partnering arrangement (the \""total FM Contract”) and a separate framework agreement. The Contracting Authority currently envisages that at the end of the procurement process the total FM contract and any framework agreement would be awarded to the successful supplier in its own right. However, the Contracting Authority is interested in exploring with the suppliers that are invited to participate in competitive dialogue what benefits, if any, would be realized by the Contracting Authority on behalf of itself or together with one or more of the participating authorities procuring as part of this procurement a strategic private sector partner with which to form a joint venture company and to which the total FM contract and any framework agreement would be awarded. The Contracting Authority therefore reserves the right as part of the current procurement to procure alongside the delivery of the total FM contract and any framework agreement, a partner with which to form a joint venture company or not to pursue this route further at the Contracting Authority’s discretion. The Contracting Authority and the participating authorities shall consider during the procurement process the structure of the client entity that it is anticipated will enter into the total FM contract and any framework agreement with the supplier and are currently giving consideration to the following options: (1) The Contracting Authority and the Participating authorities establish a wholly owned non-trading company (such as a Teckal company) which may in time convert into a trading company; or (2) The Contracting Authority enters into the total FM contract and any framework agreement on behalf of itself and the participating authorities; or (3) The Contracting Authority and the participating authorities enter into the total FM contract and any framework agreement. The above list is not an exhaustive list of options and the Contracting Authority reserves the right to consider alternative options and not to proceed with any of the options stated above. The principal outputs of the total FM contract will be to: — Deliver to specified performance levels, — Achieve efficiencies, — Deriving the benefits of a shared service model for the users of council services, — Provide value for money and accountable services from a customer perspective, — Reduce revenue costs in supporting the delivery of front-line services wherever possible, — Deliver continuous improvement and innovation in respect of these services. It is anticipated that the core requirements that may be included in the total FM contract will comprise the following: Hard Facilities Management including reactive repairs; maintenance; minor capital works; mechanical & electrical maintenance; re-lamping; fire detection and fighting systems; lifts, hoists and conveying systems; security, access and intruder systems; safety film; standby power systems maintenance; audio-visual equipment maintenance; television cabling; hard landscaping maintenance; soft landscaping maintenance; ponds and water features; internal planting; cut flowers; control of asbestos; water hygiene; statutory inspections; portable appliance testing; Building Management Systems (BMS); locksmith services; clocks; furniture management; signage.

To the extent practicable given the state of development of the PSN standards at the time of issuing the invitation to participate in dialogue, suppliers who are invited to dialogue will be required to take those standards into account in preparing their proposals with a view to ensuring a smooth transition to PSN-compliant services across the UK public sector. Buying Solutions may decide, however, not to include any such requirement in the invitation to participate in dialogue. Further information on the PSN may be found at: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/cio/public_sector_network.aspx."",""Buying Solutions as the Contracting Authority is putting in place a Pan Government framework agreement for use by UK public sector bodies (identified at VI.3) including but not limited to Central Government Departments and their Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies; NHS bodies and Local Authorities. The above Public Sector Bodies have a need for the provision of secure intranet services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need. The framework agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year’s duration. The services to be made available under the framework agreement will include network, email, application, web, hosting, security, data and information sharing including portals and remote presentation services, plus associated design, consultancy and other professional and supporting services. Services will be required to be provided for a range of impact levels up to and including 4,4,4, with possible occasional requirement for applications at higher levels. Impact levels are defined in business impact level tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. The framework agreement will enable customers to call off services to provide continuity for the Government Secure Intranet service (GSi). The GSi is part of UK Critical National Infrastructure, managed by Buying Solutions and supported by the Cabinet Office and CESG. The secure network and community of secure services operating over it that are created through procurements made via this framework agreement are referred to in this document as the “Secure Intranet”. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. The duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework will be the subject of discussion at later procurement stages, but in any event will not exceed 4 years. Related procurements.

Standards. Framework suppliers will be required to comply with the following standards and requirements: — Next Generation Networks (NGNs). The contracting authority recognises the benefits associated with Next Generation Networks (NGNs), and the need for the associated risks and issues to be addressed within this tender in relation to services offered that are based on NGN technologies. The NGN Procurement Standards Project was initiated as part of the Cabinet Office’s NGN Risk Mitigation Programme, and the resulting guidance may be downloaded from: www.ogc.gov.uk/procurement_documents_telecoms_procurement.asp. — Sustainability. The sustainability of services offered under the framework will be key in reducing customers’ carbon footprint, not only in energy consumption but also in enabling further wider reduction. In addition, the sustainability of contractors’ sources of supply will be a key consideration. As such, sustainability will be a common theme throughout the lifetime of the framework and the call-off contracts awarded under it. Public Sector Network (PSN). The UK PSN is a developing concept of interoperating services creating the effect of a single network. The standards will govern both interconnection of service provider networks and the relevant key service characteristics/attributes that ensure interoperability and end-to-end service assurance. To the extent practicable given the state of development of the PSN standards at the time of issuing the invitation to participate in dialogue, suppliers who are invited to dialogue will be required to take those standards into account in preparing their proposals with a view to ensuring a smooth transition to PSN-compliant services across the UK public sector. Buying Solutions may decide, however, not to include any such requirement in the invitation to participate in dialogue. Further information on the PSN may be found at: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/cio/public_sector_network.aspx."",""Buying Solutions as the Contracting Authority is putting in place a Pan Government Framework Agreement for use by UK public sector bodies (identified at VI.3) including but not limited to Central Government Departments and their Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies; NHS bodies and Local Authorities. The above Public Sector Bodies have a need for the provision of managed telecommunications services to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information. This Framework Agreement will address this need. The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of 2 years, with the option to extend for 2 further terms each of up to 1 year’s duration. The services to be made available under the Framework Agreement will include voice, video, unified communications and network services, plus associated design, consultancy and other professional and supporting services. Services will be required to be provided for a range of Impact Levels up to and including 3,3,4, with possible occasional requirement for applications at higher levels. Impact Levels are defined in Business Impact Level Tables contained in document “HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1”, the relevant extract from which may be obtained from the CESG website at www.cesg.gov.uk/policy_technologies/policy/policy.shtml. As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the Framework Agreement, Buying Solutions intends to hold one or more further competitions with the Framework Suppliers to award call-off contract(s) to replace the Managed Telecommunications Service (Mts), a service managed by Buying Solutions that provides managed telecommunications solutions for the public sector. Other customers (and Buying Solutions) may call-off additional contracts under this Framework Agreement. The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the framework may also be used by UK Contracting Authorities to service their overseas sites. [Note: this wording is slightly more specific than the wording in the draft PSNS OJEU notice but it remains doubtful whether it would be sufficient to permit extensive use of the framework overseas especially since there is no assessment of overseas coverage. Perhaps a minor point since UK authorities with overseas premises will be able to use the Echo framework in any event]. The duration of call-off contracts placed under this framework will be the subject of discussion at later procurement stages, but in any event will not exceed 4 years. Related Procurements. This is one of several related OJEU notices issued or planned in association with the provision of telecommunications services to the UK public sector as part of a general transition to PSN standards (see below). Others are listed below: — GSi Convergence Framework to provide continuity for the Government Secure Intranet (GSi), and, so far as practicable, to facilitate the transition to PSN-compliant services (OJEU notice published concurrently with this notice), — Procurements to establish a range of PSN central services (services that underpin the core infrastructure of the PSN), — Two procurements for provision of PSN-compliant services. Services to be provided within this Framework Agreement. The services listed below are required to be offered as Managed Services, defined as delivery of services or applications from end to end, including support processes and "

The solution/supplier will: 1) support an excellent-rated Adult Social Care department to carry out its day to day operations in an effective and efficient manner and to support the demands of the changing National Personalisation Agenda; 2) be installed, configured, tested, provide data migration services (if necessary), provide business change consultancy (if required), be signed off for acceptance and provide the ongoing maintenance and support; 3) have the capability to integrate with internal systems namely, but not restricted to, Oracle eBusiness Suite R12 (financials, CRM) and Wisdom EDRMS; 4) have the capability to integrate with external systems (e.g. NHS bodies, GPs, primary care trusts, police, other local authorities, third sector systems) to take advantage of potential partnership projects with external agencies and provide an integrated customer portal that allows service users to self-service; 5) provide the relevant level of training where deemed appropriate. Other considerations: 1) The Council is exploring opportunities to deliver shared services through this procurement. An option is therefore required (which also includes the right to grant sub-licences) that will allow the Council to deliver the functionality of any procured solution to other local authorities and public bodies (including NHS) within the East Midlands Region to maximise the opportunities from any investments and to deliver an overall cost effective service/solution that is flexible and scalable to meet the shared services agenda and changing needs. 2) Market testing for the Adults requirement has revealed that a single solution may be capable of delivering an Adult and Children's solution. Whilst the Council already has a Children's solution (contract expires Autumn 2015), the Council's long term vision is to rationalise and standardise solutions, if at all possible. This procurement exercise will therefore have an option to deploy and/or migrate the Children's component at a later date, if appropriate, in the most cost effective manner. 3) Whilst the Council currently has an in-house solution this procurement exercise will include an alternative option for an offsite hosted solution/service. Due to the complex and long term nature of this procurement the Council is looking for a strategic partner that is experienced, knowledgeable and can assist and guide the Council to meet its aims and long term objectives. Contract Period. Interested bidders should note that, subject to the comments below, the contract term will be for a period of 7 years (this includes up to an estimated 2 year implementation and migration period) with an option to extend for a further 10 years on an annual or multiple year basis taking the contract term to a maximum of 17 years. Leicestershire County Council anticipate the following: 1. The Contract shall become effective upon the date on which the Agreement is signed. Following this there shall be an initial period of two years or sooner, to allow the implementation, migration, testing and acceptance of the solution. 2. Upon satisfactory and successful completion of the migration, implementation, testing and acceptance of the solution the contract term of 5 years shall immediately commence, including Support and Maintenance of the whole solution. 3. Upon expiry of the said contract term of 5 years the Council will have an option to extend the contract, including Support and Maintenance, on an annual or multiple years basis, up to a maximum period or periods not exceeding ten (10) years in total.

322638-2011,2011,"{""North Bristol NHS Trust (the Trust) wishes to appoint: (a) a healthcare service partner for the delivery of community rehabilitation beds for NHS patients from a new Health and Social Care Centre to include a Community Hospital at Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1JE; and (b) a development partner to develop a new Health and Social Care Centre to include a Community Hospital at Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1JE for the benefit of the Trust. The requirement is for the appointed healthcare service partner to provide nursing care services and basic care and support for the NHS community hospital beds with the NHS providing medical and therapy services for these beds. The requirement is for the appointed development partner to finance, design, construct, and maintain new buildings which are suitable for accommodating: (i) an ambulatory care facility of 2 000 m2 (net area) (including outpatient clinics, physiotherapy and diagnostics) for the Trust, plus shared communal/support areas; and (ii) a 68-bedded community in-patient rehabilitation unit, which is expected to be occupied by NHS patients. And in addition, the Trust would be willing to consider the provision of a private nursing care bedded unit if there is a demonstrable cost benefit to (i) and (ii). The exact configuration as to how these 3 elements integrate to provide care and efficiency benefits will form part of design solutions proposed by the bidders during the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. The Trust expects to sell the freehold of the land (up to a maximum of 5.8 acres) to the developer required to build the facilities mentioned above. Once the facility/facilities are complete, the Trust is expected to take a leasehold interest from the developer of the ambulatory care facility. The Trust expects to enter into a service contract for the provision of nursing care services and basic care and support for the 68-bedded unit. The commercial details of the service contract and leasehold arrangements are still being developed and the final specification requirements will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. However at this stage it is envisaged that the term of the lease for the ambulatory care facility will be between 25-30 years and the optimum service contract period will be tested during dialogue and will be for a maximum of 30 years. The design and construction of the NHS element of the new Health and Social Care Centre will be in accordance with NHS guidance and the Trust’s specifications. The facilities covered by this procurement will be of high architectural quality and environmentally sustainable with the NHS element of the new facilities built to Breeam healthcare excellent standard. It is envisaged that the successful partner will also be required to provide Hard FM (facilities management) and Soft FM services to the ambulatory care facility and the 68-bedded community in-patient rehabilitation unit and private nursing care bedded unit (the provision of Soft FM being an integral part of the nursing care to be provided). The scope of the equipment provision specification and IM&T specification for the facilities will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. Should the proposed design solutions allow, it may be possible for the appointed partner to incorporate third-party revenue generating opportunities which will bring efficiency and financial benefits to the scheme and will compliment and provide health and social care integration benefits. The appointed partner may also be offered the opportunity to acquire not more than 10 acres of additional surplus land (which is likely to be adjacent to the main development site and currently forms part of the current Frenchay Hospital site) on a freehold basis which can be used by the development partner to deliver further independent Extra Care Housing development(s) in a manner which is beneficial to the Trust. The opportunity to acquire the additional surplus land (if the Trust decides to incorporate it into the opportunity) will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. The Trust would encourage bidders to incorporate solutions for the surplus land which compliment the development of a health and social care campus and provide some health and social care integration benefits with the Trust’s facilities. The opportunity may also include similar arrangements being provided at a further site in Bristol or South Gloucestershire which is within the Trust’s ownership. This is likely to include new ambulatory care facilities, GP premises and in a nursing home. Should the proposed solution allow, it may be possible to incorporate third-party revenue generating opportunities which will bring efficiency and financial benefits to the scheme and will compliment and provide health and social care integration benefits. The Trust’s requirements, particularly the inclusion of the surplus land and the inclusion of a further development site are still being developed and the Trust’s requirements will be provided to bidders short-listed to commence the competitive dialogue stage of the competition. The Trust reserves the right not to award this opportunity or to award only part (or a different arrangement) of the opportunity described in this OJEU notice. Although it is currently envisaged that the Trust will be the contracting authority conducting this procurement future government guidance, policy, regulation or NHS re-organisation may require a successor body to become the contracting authority to conclude the procurement exercise. This may include among others an NHS Foundation Trust or a central government body.""}"

Overall, numbers of undergraduate and postgraduate students on the Tremough Campus are expected to grow to around 5 000 students for the combined total for UoE and UCF by 2016. (5) Four major new projects are being or are to be undertaken in order to cater for this expansion of student numbers. These are: the Academy for Innovation and Research (\""AIR\""); the Environment and Sustainability Institute (\""ESI\""); the Exchange Project (\""Exchange\""); and the Performance Centre (and associated infrastructure works relating to each building). Procurement of a contractor or contractors for the design and construction of these four projects is not the subject of this contract notice (and have been, or are being, separately procured in a separate contract notice). (6) The purpose of this contract notice is to procure a contractor to design and construct various new enabling works on the Tremough Campus to enable the construction of AIR, ESI and Exchange. The enabling works will also include works to comply with conditions within the planning consent for the Performance Centre. (7) TDV wishes to procure a contractor to design and construct various new enabling works on the Tremough Campus to enable the construction of AIR, ESI and Exchange (the “basic contract”). Further, TDV also wishes the same chosen contractor to be able to perform some “Option” enabling works should there be sufficient funding available to permit them. These are described, in summary, below. TDV reserves the right to find alternative sources of funding. Please see the information memorandum and the combined pre-qualification questionnaire and invitation to tender for further and more detailed information. (A) The proposed basic contract for the enabling works is expected to include the completion of the design and / or construction of: (a) Upgrading or construction of various paths, drives and roads, including surfacing works, the provision of appropriate lighting and closed-circuit television systems and any necessary landscaping; (b) Provision of a second telecommunications duct service link to the Performance Centre; (c) Various landscaping works, including the planting / construction of a shelter belt and a vegetative strip; (d) Construction and connection of a new electrical sub-station on the bus island and removal of the existing electrical sub-station from the proposed Exchange footprint; (e) Re-routing and / or replacement of gas, water, electrical and telecommunications duct services and foul and storm water drainage systems where these cross the proposed footprint of the Exchange; (f) Construct a new bus interchange on the Tremough Campus consisting of 6 bus bays / stops; (g) Construction of: (i) a car park of approximately 160 car parking spaces, including provision of appropriate lighting and closed-circuit television systems and associated landscaping; and (ii) 10 - 15 additional car parking spaces; and (h) The waste compound and water, electricity and telecommunications duct service links to the Performance Centre. (B) The proposed “Option” enabling works is expected to include the completion of the design and / or construction of: (a) Option 1 - (i) Excavation of the proposed site area for AIR; and (ii) Construct the AIR site hoarding; (b) Option 2 - (i) The footpath link from the Performance Centre to the boundary adjacent to Penryn College, including the provision of appropriate lighting and closed-circuit television systems; and (ii) The footpath link to the A39 roundabout near to the ASDA supermarket store from the farm access road including the provision of appropriate lighting and closed-circuit television systems; (c) Option 3 - The widening of the existing road to the west of the bus island between its junction with the existing entrance road and the start of the haul road; (d) Option 4 - In the event that AIR does not proceed (for whatever reason), the contractor awarded the contract which is the subject of this contract notice may only be required to construct a new bus interchange on the Tremough Campus consisting of 5 bus bays / stops; and (e) Option 5 - The electrical and telecommunications duct service links to the Tremough Campus machine room. (C) Please note that: (i) the proposed basic contract of the enabling works is expected to be funded by a combination of funding streams relating to the design and construction of the Performance Centre, AIR, ESI and Exchange; (ii) Option 1 is expected to be funded by the funding stream relating to the design and construction of AIR; (iii) Option 2 is expected to be funded by the funding stream relating to the design and construction of the Performance Centre; (iv) Option 3 is expected to be funded by other TDV funding; (v) Option 4 is expected to be funded by the funding stream relating to the design and construction of AIR; and (vi) Option 5 is expected to be funded by other TDV funding. To the extent that the funding streams mentioned above is / are rejected, or is / are approved but with insufficient funding to allow completion of the proposed enabling works set out above, TDV reserves the right to reduce the scope of the basic contract of enabling works or the proposed “Option” enabling works and / or cancel the proposed basic contract of enabling works or the proposed “Option” enabling works in their entirety. Similarly, to the extent that any relevant planning approval application(s) is / are rejected, or is / are approved but with limitations or conditions that, in TDV's ultimate discretion, render the proposed works unviable at their present scope, TDV reserves the right to reduce the scope of the basic contract of enabling works or the proposed “Option” enabling works and / or cancel the proposed basic contract of enabling works or the proposed “Option” enabling works in their entirety. (8) Further details regarding both the proposed basic contract and the \""Option\"" enabling works will be provided in the \""tender documents\"" (i.e. the information memorandum, the combined pre-qualification questionnaire and invitation to tender (\""Invitation to Tender\""), TDV amendments to the Invitation to Tender and potential Tenderer / Tenderer queries, questions and requests for clarification regarding these documents and TDV's responses to these queries, questions and requests). (9) To the extent necessary for Tenderers to complete their tenders pursuant to this contract notice, further information on the procurement of a contractor / contractors to design and construct AIR, ESI, Exchange and the Performance Centre (and associated infrastructure works relating to each building) will be provided in the tender documents. (10) Please note that TDV reserves the right to cancel the selection and evaluation process at any stage for this contract opportunity, for any reason, including, but not limited to: the fact that the grant funding application(s) relevant to a particular building (i.e. AIR, ESI, Exchange or the Performance Centre) is / are rejected, or is / are approved but with insufficient funding to allow completion of that building and / or the works subject to this contract notice; or the fact that the planning approval application(s) is / are rejected, or is / are approved but with limitations or conditions that in TDV's ultimate discretion render the proposed works / development unviable.

299473-2014,2014,"{""Inverness Campus is one of the most exciting and important projects being developed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise over the next 20 years. Internationally connected, the Campus will enable thriving businesses to work hand in hand in sharing knowledge and resources with those in research and education. The Phase 1 infrastructure contract was completed in the Summer of 2013 with a number of different bodies now developing individual plots with the first buildings likely to be completed in 2015. See http://www.invernesscampus.co.uk for more information. This contract will be awarded on behalf of the Inverness Campus Owners Association (ICOA). This is made up of representatives of site owners within Phase 1 although, for some years, the ICOA will effectively be controlled by HIE since it will remain the principal owner of the development plots. The current members are Highlands & Islands Enterprise and Inverness College UHI. Note, this tender does not cover security services for buildings or structures (other than the Security Office and Maintenance Compound) which may be erected by others on the development plots. However, the successful bidder will be expected to co-operate with plot developer's on-site security staff as and when required.
