This is a voluntary notice as it relates to a service concession under Regulation 6 (2)(m) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 and as such, in carrying out this competitive process the Contracting Authority is not obliged to follow the detailed rules and procedures set out in Directive 2004/18/EC and the Public Contracts Regulations 2006, SI 2006 05. This notice is to alert interested economic operators of the start of a competitive process, and does not mark the start of a regulated procedure. The competitive process will involve proposals from suppliers on the scope of services and the nature of commercial terms. This process will be similar to the restricted procedure as detailed in the Public Procurement Regulations 2006 and will be set out in the tender documentation. The Contracting Authority intends to award service concession agreements for 4 years, with options for two further 1 year extensions. These concessions are available for use by other government departments and agencies, including other agencies of the Home Office. The services which are the subject of the concessions may comprise in outline: — provide a web-based, high availability interface comprising: —— user management, —— data gathering, —— data staging, —— secure transfer of data to and from the authority in near real time, —— display of return data, —— check history management, — maintain data in flight and in storage in a secure fashion in line with the HMG Security Policy Framework, — take and manage payments from customers, — produce and provide regular Management Information, — implement a support framework to internally resolve issues with its ICT equipment and maintain customer service, — promote the service in line with the concession agreement, — the architecture must be capable of supporting future entitlement verification services. The Authority may require optional future services enabling remote checks, which may include: — biometric chip reading technology for download, — biometric chip reading hardward for sale/rent. The concession will be offered in one lot comprising the services required for Employers’ Checking Service. Economic operators may only tender for the lot in its entirety. Further details are given below. 1. Variant bids may only be considered if they meet UKBA standards and offer superior customer value. 2. Any service providers who are successful in being granted a concession to provide employers' checking services to the public will generate income through charging a fee to those members of the public who wish to use the service. UKBA anticipates a period of technological and service development and testing after the award of concession and before the service is offered to the public. Service providers will be responsible for funding all development and deployment activities. This service is to be cost neutral to the Contracting Authority. 3. Service providers who progress to the invitation to tender stage will be asked to quote prices that they propose to charge for the services. These proposed prices will be assessed for competitiveness as part of the tender evaluation. 4. The services must be available widely within the UK. 5. UKBA is looking for one supplier to provide the Employers’ Checking Service, but may consider a greater number depending on the nature of offers made. UKBA reserves the right to make the concessions available to other parts of the Home Office and other government departments.""}"

Virgin Trains (VT) has a Franchise Committed Obligation (FCO) to replenish its fleet of Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs). This Major Project will see us order and install in the region of 130 TVMs. The TVMs are required to provide sufficient retail / Ticket on Departure (TOD) collection capacity until at least 2017, and will include both cash/card and card-only models. As a result of this project, the majority of our managed stations will offer at least one cash/card TVM, thereby supporting / enabling customers making cash purchases to migrate from our Ticket Offices. The TVMs will be fully RSP-accredited / compliant, support our Nectar offer from installation and will be fully maintained and supported by the manufacturer. We are keen to enhance the customer experience and make travelling by train as easy as possible. This project will therefore look to make tickets available to customers in more locations and to make more cash/card machines available whilst supporting new technologies like contactless card payments. This will also reduce the amount of time that customers will need to queue to purchase tickets in the busiest periods.""}"

To ensure maximum instrumental access and indeed the quality of instrumentation and data, we seek to arrange a high level of on going servicing/support to achieve maximum sample throughput and experimental impact. New XPS instrumentation (Requirement 1) is required to support research activities that span the Faculties of Science and Engineering in addition to the re-location of existing instrumentation (Requirement 2). Some of our critical and primary performance requirements include a reliable X-ray source that is proven to deliver a high flux of incident photons of energies within the range 2.5 to 4.0 KeV. The X-ray source MUST be monochromatic and have an operational the line width less than 2.5 eV, there is a working preference to Ag L infinity (2984.2 eV). The ability to switch monochromated X-ray sources from Hard (Ag L infinity to Soft (Al K infinity), with minimal instrument reconfiguration and loss of experimental time is also a requirement. The existing XPS is currently provided by a Kratos Axis Ultra instrument (ULTRA-1) which as part of this ITT is required to be re-located into the new XPS facility. Currently this instrument runs all samples both solid state and liquid. As a result of this tender process the ULTRA-1 instrument will predominantly investigate solid samples.

The new LiPPS instrument is designed to probe solution processes, e.g. chemistry, by moving to a harder X-ray source (i.e Ag L infinity) which is more bulk sensitive in the normal emission mode, of course, increased surface sensitivity may be obtained by moving to a grazing angle, i.e. angle resolved XPS (AR-XPS). LiPPS is complimentary to traditional XPS analysis, using softer sources, and as such will support the national XPS facility (NEXUS), located in Newcastle. Full data compliance across systems both at UoN and indeed NEXUS is essential.

The new equipment to be purchased is to be dedicated primarily to the investigation of ionic liquid samples (LiPPS). The instrument will be co-located in the new XPS facility. Liquid-based samples are typically composed of ionic liquids or solutions thereof, the vapour pressures of which are vanishingly small, rending then suitable for study under UHV. (NB - there is no expectation to include ambient pressure XPS of materials not compatible to UHV). The new LiPPS instrument is designed to probe solution processes, e.g. chemistry, by moving to a harder X-ray source (i.e Ag L infinity) which is more bulk sensitive in the normal emission mode, of course, increased surface sensitivity may be obtained by moving to a grazing angle, i.e. angle resolved XPS (AR-XPS). LiPPS is complimentary to traditional XPS analysis, using softer sources, and as such will support the national XPS facility (NEXUS), located in Newcastle. Full data compliance across systems both at UoN and indeed NEXUS is essential. Servicing of the new LiPPS instrument (Requirement 1) for 3 yrs must be included and on the relocated ULTRA-1 instrument (Requirement 2) for a minimum of one year, full warranty is required on both instruments. Additional provision for maintenance cover of LiPPS and ULTRA-1 instrumentation is required, taking the form of either i) extended warranty or ii) pre-purchase of engineering support (or parts) at preferential reduced rates. This Tender is set out with 2 main requirements, bidders may tender for either requirement or both.""}"
